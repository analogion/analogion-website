        Here is what the Patriarchal music committee of 1881 has to tell us about melodic
        attractions in the First Mode heirmologic.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the heirmologic melodies the note BOU on ascent is attracted by GA and is sharpened
        by one tmema [i.e. two moria] and the note GA as well is attracted by DI and is
        sharpened by four tmemata [i.e. eight moria], on descent these notes remain natural.
        The note Zw when the melody does not go beyond it is flattened by three tmemata
        [i.e. a semitone], but when the melody goes to Ni, on ascent it is taken natural
        and on descent it is flattened by three tmemata. As an example of these attractions
        see [the heirmos] "Sou he tropaiouchos dexia".

        <br>
        <br>
        Furthermore when discussing the Fourth Mode papadic, the Committee tells us that
        GA of the Fourth Mode papadic behaves as GA of the First Mode.

        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis</span>:Compare the above scores and notice the
        differences when notating (or not) melodic attractions in similar theseis. Given
        the utter confusion among different composers and theoreticians over the issue of
        notating elxeis, does it make sense to notate them at a such fine level of detail
        at all? Is it not better to learn them by ear?
        <p />
        Efthemiadis supports that GA is raised on ascent by 8 moria, following the recommendation
        of the Patriarchal Committee. However he notates it with a simple, uncrossed sharp
        sign. I also support such simple notation, if the melodic attraction is to be notated
        at all.
        <p />
        In the two recordings presented above, Stanitsas does traditional intervals. Damarlakis
        sounds off-key at places.
