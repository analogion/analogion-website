    Alexander Lingas has written a beautiful essay entitled: "Tradition and Renewal
    in Contemporary Greek Orthodox Psalmody" found in "Psalms in Community" edited by
    Attridge and Fassler, 2003. The final two paragraphs of his essay comment on the
    state of psalmody in America, where he writes the following:<br>
    <br>
    "One particular area of concern that has yet to be addressed significantly in practice
    is the virtual absence [in Greece] of congregational singing... The situation is
    somewhat different in the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, where some members
    of the clergy and the laity have also expressed a desire for increased congregational
    participation. Historical circumstances such as the coincidence of Greek immigrations'
    height in the early twentieth century with the period of Greek music's maximal
    Westernization [59] {see footnotes below} as well as the pressures of assimilation,
    contributed to the development of a distinctly Greek-American tradition of Orthodox
    liturgical music. [60] In many American parishes, plainchant--often sung by cantors
    who have received only limited training in Byzantine music--is used only for offices
    and weekday services. This is because the Sunday Divine Liturgy has generally become
    the preserve of mixed choirs with electronic organs, who sing musical settings influenced
    strongly by Russian and Western prototypes. [61] Most attempts to foster congregational
    singing in America have therefore not been inspired by the traditions and history
    of Orthodox psalmody but by Protestant hymnals. [62]<br>
    <br>
    "There are, however, now tentative signs--most visibly the increased space devoted
    in recent editions of the National Forum of Greek Orthodox Church Musicians' annual
    'Liturgical Guidebook' to rubrics for psalm verses that were customarily omitted--that
    a revival of psalmody may also be occurring in the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of
    America. Presently observable trends [this essay was written in 2002] that would
    appear to be contributing to the renewal of Greek Orthodox psalmody in North America
    include greater familiarity with liturgical structures brought about by the use
    of English in worship, more frequent contact with church musicians from other Orthodox
    jurisdictions, [63] the recent establishment of a significant number of Greek Orthodox
    monasteries, and the growing popularity of recordings of chant, especially those
    featuring adaptations of traditional melodies to English. [64] One should also not
    discount the missionary zeal of those who have<br>
    experienced the newly revitalised psalmodic traditions of Greece at first hand.
    Like the emissaries of Prince Vladimir who wished to recapture the experience of
    worship at the Constantinopolitan Hagia Sophia in their native Kievan Rus, a small
    but significant group of American clergy and church musicians are now working hard
    to restore a sense of heavenly glory to psalmody in their own Greek Orthodox parishes."<br>

    them...well over a decade ago. We have grown very much in the process. Now we are
    learning to read Byzantine chant which is spurned on by all that has become available
    in recent years.<br>
    <br>
    Our goal is simple: to offer the Byzantine hymnology of the Greek Orthodox Church,
    in English, to the faithful (and if the Lord wills, outside the Church as well).
    So much of our Faith is expressed through its hymnology, and we want to make that
    accessible to the average English-speaking Orthodox Christian".<br>

    "...the sheet music you find on our website is not "traditional Byzantine chant."    Most of it certainly is chant and Byzantine-inspired, but it is mostly written for
    American choirs to use during Divine Liturgies. The music Nancy chants at the psalterion
    is not the same as she puts on paper for use by Western choirs. She simplifies the
    chant and makes it easy for them to read without organ accompaniment. The music
    follows basic Byzantine rules for syllable placement and replicates the tonal qualities
    of the octoechos as closely as is possible in Western notation, but because of these
    limitations and the inexperience of American choirs, it cannot be called traditional
    Byzantine, and we are upfront about this.
    <br>
    <br>
    I, of course, favor the promotion in America of traditional Byzantine music by trained
    chanters, especially at Vespers and Orthros and other services where there are usually
    chanters only and no choir. I hope Byzantine music by psaltis gets better in America,
    because I have noticed that many of them (priests, too!) do not know the tones or
    the melodies, or what to do in certain circumstances.
    <br>
    <br>
    However, for Sunday liturgies, it does not seem to me as if chanters are going to
    replace choirs any time soon, and the music on our website offers these choirs a
    chance to sound more like traditional chant and to learn some basics at the same
    time. ... I agree, it is an intermediary between the Westernized music currently
    being employed and true, traditional chant. I hope the music on our website will
    nudge the Westernized choirs in a more traditional direction, and that they will
    be happy to learn this music and explore it further."<br>
