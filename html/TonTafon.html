        Why is the First Mode piece chanted according to the chromatic scale?</div>
    <div class="heading">
        Overview</div>
    <div class="text">
        The automelon of the First Mode "Ton tafon sou Soter" is a puzzling case of the
        First Mode piece (which is a diatonic Mode) chanted with chromatic scale. The solution
        proposed by some musicologists (Petros Philanthidis, Simon Karas, and in more recent
        times by L. Angelopoulos' school and Gr. Stathis) to resolve the issue (if any)
        says that in fact in mediaeval times "Ton tafon sou Soter" belonged to the First
        Mode Diphonos or Naos, which some chanters also call "Pathetikos" and identify with
        makam "Sabah", but through the course of time chanters started to chant the piece
        using the soft chromatic scale. L. Angelopoulos' school supports the view that the
        results of their theoretical research must be implemented in practice. Interesting
        enough, the slow kollybadic version of the kathisma "O megas strategos" (which is
        the prosomoion of "Ton tafon sou Soter") transcribed by Fr. Georgios Regas from
        the oral tradition of Skiathos island belongs to the diatonic genre.</div>

        Questions and answers</div>
    <div class="question">
        What is the First Mode Diphonos or Naos?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">I. Arvanitis:</span> The name Naos and its nature are best described
        in Gabriel Ieromonachos' treatise (late byzantine) as simply the Diphonos of the
        Exo Protos. What does this mean? It simply means that in chants of Exo Protos (i.e.
        the Protos on Ke, the common Protos of the Old Sticherarion and Heirmologion), one
        can find phrases beginning from Ke and cadencing on Ni (remember the music of the
        word ''ypsothite'' in my transcription of the mediaeval ''Christos gennatai'').
        Today you can find such phrases in the Stichera of the Plagal of First Mode (see
        e.g. the last phrases of the two Eothina of Pl. Protos in the Anastasimatarion by
        Ioannis Protopsaltis). And, of course, the heirmologic Pl. Protos is mainly Naos,
        as well as, a very similar to it, sticheraric Protos, commonly written now on Pa
        (with medial cadences on Ga) but usually sung in a higher tessitura, so that it
        could be written on Ke. BTW, in the times of Koukouzelis, the heirmologic Protos
        was almost entirely Naos, i.e. it sounded like the present-day heirmologic Plagios
        Protos.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        Does the First Mode Diphonos use the same scale as makam Sabah?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">I. Arvanitis:</span> No mention or hint of chromatic intervals
        in Naos is mentioned by Gabriel and one cannot claim that the present-day Naos (in
        the cases I've mentioned above) must be always chromatic. Its chromatic character
        appears only as a matter of attractions, i.e. only when the melody touches Pa for
        a cadence on Ni, or, sometimes, when descending from Bou to a cadence on Ni, Pa
        is slightly flattened (the flattening is very slight, 2-3 kommas, much less than
        e.g. Lycourgos Angelopoulos sings it. One almost doesn't need to think of it so
        much, so there is a smooth transition from phrases with a flattening of Pa to phrases
        without it. This is the true oral tradition). A chromatic Naos is present chiefly
        in new Byzantine compositions of the last two centuries and in folk songs. Karas
        probably wanted to present Byzantine tradition and folk song as one tradition of
        the Greek Nation. This is of course to a high degree true, but folk and church tradition
        need not be identical in every detail. So, Karas presented chromatic Naos as an
        Echos of this combined tradition, without making any distinction regarding its use.

        Discussion in the byzantinechant forum</div>
    <div class="text">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> If at some time in the past that automelon
        was chanted in 1st mode diphonos (Naos), then is that a compelling reason to change
        current practice (that says it is chanted in 2nd mode)?
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="name">I. Arvanitis:</span> Now, if we must be careful to change theory
        and praxis even when the results of our research are fully justified, we must be
        much more careful when we have only some indications for the need of a change or
        when we have only a suspicion and make a hypothesis about an issue. In the case
        of "Ton tafon sou Sotir", the assertion or hypothesis that it was sung in the Protos
        Diphonos "Naos" finds no support. No support of course in the oral tradition, but
        also no support in the manuscripts. In Petros Vyzantios, Petros Pampadarios, Balasios,
        Theophanis Karykis Heirmologia (which include melodies similar or directly comparable
        to the now used) the Martyria is always that of Exo Protos. No indication of Diphonia
        after this Martyria. And the melody starts clearly from Di-Ke (it could be written
        with the Martyria of Exo Protos alone and then have two Oliga on "Ton ta-" wich
        would prove that it is Naos. But it's never written so). So, no sign of Naos in
        these mss. In the 15th/14th cent. the heirmologic chants (and some short papadic
        also) of Protos ech. were actually sung in Naos (=Protos from Ke with cadences on
        Ni; not necessarily chromatic of course). But in the mss of the same period "Ton
        tafon sou sotir" is clearly written in Eso Protos (from Pa) with a melody entirely
        different from the later melodies! So, no evidence for Naos for this chant, no need
        of change for the current theory and praxis. To be honest, Karas did not so much
        present it as his own theory (he attributes it to Philanthidis. Karas tries to give
        more arguments which can be proved to be wrong) or did not insist so much for a
        need of change of the praxis of all the psaltai (I remember him singing it in the
        2nd mode in the chapel of his school). He rather proposed it as a solution to the
        paradox that it belongs to the 1st mode but is sung in the 2nd; Chromatic Naos can
        be thought as a combination of the two modes (this paradox can be solved in another
        way). The insistence on the need of a change is the work of Angelopoulos and his
        group. (I did not give here my whole argumentation. There is also more evidence
        that this troparion must remain as it is. I have collected my notes on this and
        intend to publish a small book, part of a wider work on the "Epeisakta". I don't
        know when, but we'll see).
