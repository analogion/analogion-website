<pre wrap=""><span class='name'> G. K. Michalakis</span><br><br>Now, although Di is lower in first mode, it is NOT hyphesis as the <br>Australian Byzantine Choir does it in the Koinonikon (EXCEPT if an <br>hyphesis is put in the score, which I don't have....). So, Lower that <br>piano Di is NOT to be confused with Di Hypesis, which is even lower...<br><br><span class='name'>D. Koubaroulis<br><br></span>There is no yphesis in the score. The ABC intentionally chose to do <br>it yphesis (flat).<br><br><span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis<br><br></span>Why?????<br><br><span class='name'>D. Koubaroulis</span><br><br>It is not unusual in classical compositions for DI to be yphesis <br>when the melody moves around GA.<br><br><span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis</span><br><br>NO.... such an elxeis has a PRECISE fuction, and there is NO reason<br>for it in this piece... it sounds IMMEDIATELY ackward to one who<br>knowns of its parsemonious use, and it just doesn't stick with the<br>lines that precede and follow...<br><br><span class='name'>D. Koubaroulis</span><br><br>Often, the yphesis is not written but is still applied.<br><br><span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis</span><br><br>I'm not so sure... this is all CONTEMPORARY muscicology.  Di is<br>NATURALLY a bit low in Psaltiki, there is no reason to turn the thing<br>to some "pathitikos"... ABSOLUTELY no reason at all...<br><br><span class='name'>D. Koubaroulis</span><br><br>I had another look at that as I was speaking from memory. The score <br><b
 class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>does<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> have an yphesis (flat) on DI as do many slow classical <br>compositions in similar theseis. So the ABC is correct and this is not a <br>contemporary musicology invention. The issue remains whether this DI <br>flat is the same as Sabah or not. I maintain my position that the <br>yphesis is often not written but performed.</pre>
<pre wrap=""><span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis</span></pre>
<pre wrap="">From the above one can easily guess my answer:  what does plagal <br>first have to do with SABAH????<br><br>The only place for "sabah" is when changing from heptaphonic diatonic <br>ZO to ZO enharmonic OF SAME PITCH, and when coming back to diatonic <br>tetraphonos, DI is LOWERED to as to bring the melody back to <br>its "basis" and to ists special intervals. Such passages usually have <br>plagals second  or Kliton associated.  And this "sabah" acts only to <br>help bring back the melody to the special Ga...  So, it's not <br>really "SABAH" from there on down to Pa (because the intervals are <br>already smaller)...<br><br>Now, that Pringos and auto-proclaimed Pringos students made "belly <br>dancing" sabah liturgics in "first mode pathitikos" is does another <br>one of them classical "massacres" of what is NOBLE in psaltiki.... a <br>nice first mode, with a lower than piano Di WITHOUT any <br>SABAHISATION....</pre>

<pre wrap=""> I didn't understand your explanation about <br>Sabah. Can you post a score with your case of Sabah. <br><br><span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis</span><br><br>Koinonikon "Eis Mnemosynon.." Barys_Mode [<a

I hope someone can <br>find this recording of his... the situation is similar:<br><br>The ison remains on Zo diatonic.  The Heptophonic Zo becomes <br>ENARMONIC, with Ano Ni and  Ano Pa lowered a bit ("special interval" <br>as applied to the octave).<br><br>Coming back down, the Di is in HYPHESIS, and the Ga is Lower than <br>diatonic, the Bou lower than diatonic, the Pa lower than diatonic, <br>the Ni more or les in its position, Zo diatonic in its position...<br>("special intervals".<br><br>Listen to the line "Eis mnimosinon aiOOOOOOOOOOOnion estai dikaios, <br>Alliluia".<br><br><span class='name'>D. Koubaroulis<br><br></span>I have always <br>thought that Sabah is the diatonic scale of First mode with DI flat and <br>ZW flat (and sometimes PA' flat too).  I have also always thought that <br>certain lines of (what I call) Sabah as borrowed between pieces of First <br>and Plagal First mode as happens with a whole lot of other lines.<br><br><br><span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis</span><br><br>That's the way many use Sabach in church today, turning it it into <br>a "fundamental" mode..... "Sabach" lines are TRANSITIONAL melody <br>lines for that one particular case in Zo diatonic.  The rest <br>is "contermporary" makamisation.<br><br>And having theard this, the "researcher" pull down Di left and right, <br>hyphesis or no hyphesis.<br><br>Listen to how I do the hypesis on the Kekragarion (it has some bad <br>intervals elsewhere, I'll re-do it, but the Di hyphesis is all <br>right:  not too low (not sabach)).  There is no reason to make first <br>mode "pathetic"...  I doesn't need to suffer sany more that it <br>already does.<br><br>All in all, "pathitikos" EXISTS in Dimotiki, as well as "ousak", as <br>a whole "mode" = makam in itself.<br><br>I NEVER heard ANY of my teachers apply it as such in CLASSICAL pieces <br>EXCEPT in Barys diatonikos. <br><br>So, it is FIRST mode for DIMOTIKI...<br><br>It is TRANSITIONAL barys in Ecclesiastical music (and all Liturgika <br>written by whomever in "pathetikos" should be put aside, and <br>all "RESEARCHER" choirs applying Di super hyphesis should do MORE <br>listening to Iakovos than to Priggos... (without knowing what to listen for)...<br><br><span class='name'>D.

The name, according to Karas <br>comes from the musical name of Third Mode (Nana) and has to do with the <br>fact that First Mode Diphonos moves around Nana (two notes higher than <br>its basis).<br><br><span class='name'>S.
