<h3>T. Stanitsa's Dynamis (Ferahnak)<br>
</h3>
<h4>B. Crow wrote:</h4>
<br>
<i>In Balamand Monastery's Recording of the Feast of St. John of
Damascus, they<br>
have a very nice rendition of the Trisagion Hymn in tone 7 "Farahnaq."
They<br>
record "Aghios o Theos" once, then "Ne. Dhinamis" and "Aghios o Theos"
a final<br>
time, three times as melismatic as the first one.<br>
A couple questions:<br>
1.. Does anyone have this in Western notation? (I really doubt whether
this<br>
has ever been transcribed.)<br>
2.. Does anyone have this in Byzantine notation?<br>
3.. Does anyone know of any other recordings of this same hymn in the
same<br>
tone ("Farahnaq")?<br>
4.. How would the "Glory . . . both now . . ." be sung (they are not<br>
included)?<br>
5.. I don't know if there's a problem with my copy of the CD, but in
listening<br>
to "Aghios o Theos" after the "Dhinamis," I can only pick out "Aghios o
Theos"<br>
and "Aghios athanatos." Where is "Aghios Iskhiros"? I have listened to
it<br>
numerous times but just can't hear it!</i><br>

<i>Please forgive me for giving the wrong explanation of maqam
Farahnaq. It<br>
&nbsp;
is actually 4th tone (agia) that resolves on lower Zw (It is not a
second<br>
&nbsp;
tone resolving on Zw) !!!!</i><br>
<h4>I. Arvanitis wrote:</h4>
Allow me a small correction : Maqam Ferahnak (meaning, I think,<br>
'joyous', from the Arabic 'farah' and the Persian ending -nak) is a
_plagal_<br>
fourth from Di resolving on lower Zw. This means that it has a 2.kommata<br>
sharp Vou and a 2 kommata sharp Ga. It can resorve on Zw using this or a<br>
diatonic scale (Vou and Ga natural). (It can make medial cadences on Vou<br>
sharp which has the idea of the lower Ke of Plagal fourth.). The<br>
nomenclature of the maqams, in terms of Byzantine music, can be based
either<br>
on the scale or on the tonic. So, eg. Hitzazkar uses the scale of Plagal<br>
second but has Nh as its tonic. So, it is called : Second plagal from
Nh or<br>
Fourth plagal chromatic. The older psaltai used the latter name. So,<br>
Ferahnak is usually called ' Tetartos phthoricos'. In my teacher's,
Simon<br>
Karas', nomenclature it would be called : Plagios tou Tetartou ek tou
Di,<br>
paraplagiazon' (eg. resolving a sixth below its tonic).<br>

<i>I have the CD now playing but unfortunately I don't have even the<br>
&nbsp;
Byzantine notation. For your information, this trisagion is a<br>
&nbsp;
transliteration of the Trisagion composed by Stanitsas on 3rd tone with<br>
some modifications (it is starts with a nice NaNa!).So it is actually
3rd tone<br>
&nbsp;
resolving on Zw.</i><br>

<h4>I. Arvanitis wrote:</h4>
Stanitsas composed it originally in Ferahnak (see above). He almost<br>
copied or was inspired by a Great Doxology composed in Ferahnak by<br>
Panagiotis Kiltzanidis (19th cent.) Because Ferahnak in general has a
wide<br>
ambitus, this Agios o Theos and Dynamis was a little modified by the<br>
Protopsaltis of Agia Sophia of Thessaloniki, Harilaos Taliadoros. He
cut and<br>
modified the cadences on Zw. He made them on the tonic Di. But in this
form,<br>
the scale and the whole piece is as if it would be written in the
Triphonos<br>
of Plagios Tetartos, the so-called 'Nana'. So, in some editions, it
appears<br>
in this mode.<br>
<h4>M. Shalloum wrote:</h4>
<i>Also, your CD is OK, there is no Agios Iskhiros !!!!! The reason for<br>
that might be Agios Iskhiros is written in Arabic and it was omitted to
save<br>
&nbsp;
track space on the CD. Whatever the reason is, I find it weird !</i><br>
<h4>I. Arvanitis wrote:</h4>
<br>
Unfortunately, modern psaltai don't like repetitions. But repetition is<br>
the history of Byzantine Chant !!!<br>

<h4><tt>B. Crow wrote:</tt></h4>
<tt>I've recently produced an English-language arrangement of the
Trisagion<br>
Hymn in Diatonic Grave Tone to the "Farahnak" melody. I transcribed the<br>
music from a recording by the Choir of the Balamand Monastery and edited<br>
it with help from some friends who checked the Byzantine notation for me<br>
in places (Mike Smith, from this list, did the proofreading and
dynamics).<br>
