        $124. "He came from the Tatavla neighbourhood of Constantinople. From his childhood
        he was distinguished for his good voice (καλλιφωνία) and talent (κλίση) regarding
        Ecclesiastical music. In the music school of Phanarion where he studied, he stood
        out for his great mimicking ability of the chanting style of the teacher of the
        school, Iakovos Nafpliotis (who was then still 1st Domestichos). For his rare voice,
        its melodicity (μελωδικότητα), flexibility (ευστροφία) and trills (και το λιγυρόν αυτής) as well as due to his good and impressive (επιδεικτικήν) interpretation
        of the Ecclesiastical music he was hired in 1911 in the Patriarchate in the position
        of 2nd Domestichos to succeed Dimitrios Fokaeus who had been promoted. After serving
        for two years, sacrifycing his "future", in 1913 he left his position, having preferred
        -instead of the Great Church- the parishes, where his profession would find a greater
        material reward."    </div>
    <div class="text">
        $187. "K. Pringos, the current Protopsaltis of the Great Church happens to be the
        best voice of all psaltai of Constantinople. Gifted with a most melodic and ecclesiastical
        voice, he follows the traditional methemata, having great zeal and love towards
        Ecclesiastical music of which he is the most famous (επισημότερος) and most important
        (σπουδαιότερος) representative but also its defender.He belongs to the party of
        ecclesiastical teachers that respected the ecclesiastical musical tradition of the
        Great Church; also knew European (Western) music. Of his compositions we mention
        Cherubic hymns in each mode, Leitourgika and "Axion Estin" in various modes. From
        the conservatism regarding the Ecclesiastical Music of this teacher depends the
        future of pure eccl. melos as well as the existing psaltic system of the Holy Patriarchal
        Church.".
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis</span>: So Boudouris acknowledges the fact that Pringos
        was the best to replace Nafpliotis. I don't know whether the last sentence ("From
        the conservatism...") is an indirect doubt of Boudouris about Pringos but it sounds
        like it to me). Boudouris also records a discussion with Nikolaos Raedestinos, the
        son of Georgios Raedestinos (former Protopsaltis of the Great Church) about Pringos.
        Here are some interesting translated quotes:
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        From book, Mousikokritika (date of interview 1941)<p />
        $584 <span class="name">Nikolaos Raidestinos</span>: "Let's take the current Protopsaltis
        Konstantinos Pringos as an example, who was called to continue the work of Iakovos
        Nafpliotis. What can I say about him? I don't know. He also seems to be lost (έχει
        χαμένον τον μπούσουλά του). How can he keep hold of what he knows when everyone
        else around him live in ignorance (άγνοιαν) of our eccl. music? However, I did support
        him for the position of Protopsaltic position after the illness of the Protopsaltis
        (IN) because he is the best of all current psaltai of Constantinople. I don't know
        what to say. I am disappointed. Alas (Κρίμα)! This national and ecclesiastical treasure
        is going to get lost! Alas!"</div>
    <div class="text">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span>Sounds like Raidestinos approves of Pringos
        but doesn't see any worthy follower. Stanitsas was probably too young at that time
        to make an impression. He was only 31 years old.

        $409. Sunday Feb 13, 1938:"The candidate for the position of Labadarios, K. Pringos,
        now right chanter at St Demetrios of Tatavla and then 2nd Patriarchal Domestikos,
        many of the Synodal Archbishops are fighting against (πολεμούσι) due to the unstable
        of his character (το άστατον του χαρακτήρος του) and his low morals (το μειωμένον
        ηθικόν του).According to the Protopsaltis (IN), despite his (Pringos') weaknesses,
        he is the most suitable psaltis for Labadarios. After all, he is a renowned psaltis
        (με όνομα) because he interprets psalmodia according to the style of the Patriarchal
        psaltai, having been his (IN's) student. IN also believes that Pringos will be capable
        of fighting against the enemies of eccl. musical tradition.When the teacher (IN)
        asked my opinion I said that I personally cannot disagree with his opinion on that
        matter. [...] That is totally up to the Protopsaltis to propose a worthy follower
        of his tradition. Someone that he will not regret afterwards, knowing how heave
        that responsibility was.<p />
        Cheesefare Sunday, 1938. Today K. Pringos was ordained Labadarios. The Protopsaltis
        seemed very satisfied and pleased because in the end his opinion prevailed so that
        his own student was appointed in that position. At the Patriarch's request, the
        chanted the slow Doxology of Iakovos Protopsaltis in 2nd Mode to test the ability
        of the new Labadarios. The new Labadarios, in the Liturgy chanted the Koinonikon
        Aineite of Ioannis Protopsaltis in Fourth mode Agia.<p />
        17th March 1938. The teacher (IN) observes that Pringos finds great difficulty (μεγάλην
        δυσχέρειαν) in fulfilling his duties. The Patriarchal church is not similar to any
        parish church . Here the psalti has to have musical knowledge, chest (breathing)
        stamina and knowledge of the Eccl. Taxis (Typikon). In the outside churches Pringos
        may have chanted showing-off (επιδεικτικώς) and uncontrollable (ανεξελέγκτως). Now,
        all that that he knew don't have any place (δεν έχουν πέρασιν) in the Patriarchal
        church in which the new Labadarios has to learn those which are used and chanted
        here.
        <p />
        14th April 1938. According to the Protopsaltis (IN), Pringos managed to get away
        the church council of St Demetrios to go to the Patriarchate by promising that he
        would send them as a substitute the acting 2nd Domestikos of the Patriarchate, Prodromos
        Topaloglou.Having a very different vocal range than Pringos, the 2nd domestikos
        Prodromos was forced (υπεχρεώθη) to leave the Patriarchal church to become the right
        chanter of St Demetrios. In his place, Dimitrios Magouris was hired as 2nd Domestikos.
        <p />
        $421. "According to the teacher, Labadarios Konstantinos finds great difficulty
        in his duties. Pringos has modernistic ideas (νεωτερικάς ιδέας) and intends to reform
        the musical choirs of the Patriarchate in the future. In that he's got the support
        of certain Patriarchal deacons who are favouring modernising reforms (φερομένων
        εις καινοτομίας). To secure their support, the current Labadarios is promising to
        do this and that. He may say many things and promise as much but he (IN) doesn't
        think he is capable of realising his promises. Because he hasn't got the talent
        (προσόντα) and ability (ικανότητας) needed to attempt such plans. The musical ability
        (οι μουσικές δυνάμεις) of Pringos is moderate (είναι μετρίου βαθμού), his ability
        of composing is very limited, that's why he makes many orthographical musical mistakes"        <p />
        $436. <span class="name">I. Nafpliotis</span>: "I don't currently see my successor
        in this art. Because they are all careless (επιπόλαιοι), they don't spend time with
        the music (δέν καταγίνονται με την μουσικήν) and with the musical products of the
        past (με τα μουσικά προϊόντα του παρελθόντος). The Labadarios, unfortunately, doesn't
        have what is required (δεν κατέχει αυτό που χρειάζεται). Now that he is with me,
        he is going to get educated with the 2nd Domestikos. I disapprove of his rushed
        action to replace the 2nd Domestikos because now they are both (Labadarios and 2nd
        Domestikos) inexperienced (πρωτόπειροι) and amateurs (αμάθητοι) with respect to
        Patriarchal psalmody. If that substitution hadn't happened, only the Labadarios
        would be inexperienced. Because Prodromos Topaloglou, despite his neglect of his
        duties, he certainly had acquired somehow the practice of the Patriarchal church"    </div>
