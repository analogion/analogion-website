        &nbsp; <i>In the old byzantine music book of Pandekti, 1851 (vol 4) the hymn<br>
            &nbsp; "Osoi eis Xriston" (Those who have been baptised in Christ)&nbsp; is<br>
            &nbsp; mentioned as First Plagal mode. The only explanation I can give as to<br>
            &nbsp; why it is not First mode (as it probably appears as in the new<br>
            &nbsp; byzantine music books) is that the melody has a descending feeling.<br>
            &nbsp; However, the endings in DI and the general melodic structure remind of<br>
            &nbsp; fist mode rather than first Plagal. What is happening there?</i><br>

        That is how it was referred in the old mss, but with diferent melodic<br>
        structure. Now in pandektis the name stayed but the structure is<br>
        probably new.
