        I was listening to randomly selected pieces from Dimitri's page on Kekragarion in
        mode 1 and what drew my attention was the way John Boyer was doing DI flat in the
        phrase "eisaAkouson...". This flat is explicitely notated in the Anastasimatarion
        and I guess everybody understands which phrase I mean. IMHO John's DI flat is too
        low for this particular thesis. Here are my objections:<br>
        <br>
        a) Such an overflattened DI sounds unnatural. I acknowledge that this is a subjective
        argument and also Karas et al have a different perception of natural/unnatural.<br>
        b) The few credible psaltai I listened to don't bring DI as low as John does, listen
        e.g. to Dositheos, Sfikas etc.<br>
        c) John's flat DI could be justified in a Sabah phrase evolving around GA, resting
        on GA, ending on GA, but not in this case.<br>
        I would like to hear theoretical/practical justifications for John's flat DI.<br>
        <br>
        <span class='name'>J. M. Boyer:

            <br>
        </span>
        <br>
        First of all, I think it's pretty clear that we have different ideas as to what
        qualifies someone as being a "credible psalti." To me, Angelopoulos is a credible
        psalti. That being said, he has a tendency to execute elxeis more extremely than
        others, as we all know.
        <br>
        <br>
        The next thing is to realize that none of the psaltai from the Patriarchate sing
        the same version of the Kekragarion I did, at least, none of the recordings on Dimitri's
        page are of the same melody. Since there is no comparable phrase in the version
        they are singing, a comparison cannot be made.
        <br>
        <br>
        So, how "credible" is, say, Fr. Kartsonas of the Holy Mountain, whose recording
        is on Dimitri's site as well? I know nothing about him, but he flats Di roughly
        the same amount in his rendering of the same phrase.
        <br>
        <br>
        Now, why I sing it the way I do:
        <br>
        <br>
        1) Because that's what my first Greek teacher (LA) does. The fact that you don't
        view my teacher as a credible psalti really doesn't matter to me one way or the
        other. As GKM would say, "I do what I have heard."        <br>
        <br>
        2) Because Simon Karas has a flat of 4 units in the same place in his theoritikon
        (vol. a', p. 253), pretty much exactly what I performed.
        <br>
        <br>
        3) Because Ga is the dominant tone (despozontos fthongos) in this part of the thesis,
        and the flip up to Di is an unaccented neighbor-tone. When Ga is dominant in the
        Lower first mode (Eso Protos), Di is attracted down to it, especially when it is
        a neighbor tone. If it were a passing tone, I wouldn't (and didn't, later in the
        recording) flat it nearly as much.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class='name'>S. Gugushvili:</span><br>
        <br>
        Nobody denies that DI is flattened (after all what is the yphesis doing there?),
        it's the degree of flatness that is a subject of disagreement. The DI flat of Angelopoulos'
        school could find justification in the following phrase from Dimitri Giannelos'
        theoretikon, but it is clear that the phrase of the first mode diphonos that he
        provides is different from the thesis in the Kekragarion: the melody evolves around
        GA, spends time on GA and ends on GA.

        The Patriarchal committee of 1881 provides a similar example:

            Listen to Iakovos as well. Listen to Katsoulis as well (although he does OTHER bad
