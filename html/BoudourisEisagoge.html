        <span class='name'>Part of chapter
            on Tempo</span><br>
        <br>
        §280 In the slow pieces (Doxastika, Polyelaioi, Cheroubika, Koinonika) we use the
        following tempo indication "argon over x". However, the kratemata are chanted with
        tempo "gorgon over x". At the end of the piece, the original tempo is restored.
        Note that the general nature of tempo in the kratemata ("apas o dromos tis agoges")
        is double ("diplous"), therefore we chant <b class="moz-txt-star">two notes at every
            hit of the hand</b> ("dyo fthoggoi eis ena ktypon").<br>
        <br>
        <span class='name'>On Rhythm and
            its components</span><br>
        <br>
        §281. The duration of beats ("chronoi") of a melody is determined by the tempo ("chronike
        agoge"). Many times, the beats of the melody have some regularity. That is the beats
        form groups which divide the melody into short, same-duration, well defined parts.
        When a certain number of beats (two, three, four, *etc.*) divides the melody regularly
        in parts of same duration, then rhythm is produced. According to the above, rhythm
        in Byzantine Music is the division of the melody into regular parts ("kata taksin")
        consisting of the same number of beats always.<br>
        <br>
        §283... Beats can be characterised as simple of complex. Simple beat ("aplos chronos")
        is the smallest unit of time that is part of rhythm. This time unit, which can not
        be further divided but only multiplied, coincides with the pronounciation ("apaggelia")
        of one short syllable of the Ancient Greeks. It was then known as "short beat"        ("chronos braxys")
        <br>
        or "first beat" ("chronos protos") or "point" ("semeion") and was notated liek this
        "u". Complex beat ("synthetos chronos") is a multiple of the simple one, that is,
        double, triiple, etc. The double beat is the so called by the Ancient Greeks "long
        beat" ("chronos makros") or "Disemos", as consisting of two units ("ws apoteloumenos
        ek dyo semeiwn") and was notated like this "__".<br>
        <br>
        §286 One "short beat" of the Ancient Greeks lasts exactly as one quantity sign of
        Byzantine Music (excl. the hyporroe) without it carrying any time-related signs,
        <b class="moz-txt-star">when the melody is heirmologic</b>.<br>
        <br>
        §287. The beats of the melody form groups, each consisting of 2, 3,4 <b class="moz-txt-star">
            etc</b>. These groups are called bars ("podes h metra").<br>
        <br>
        §288. ... There are various types of bars:<br>
        Disemos bars: consisting of two short beats<br>
        Trisemos bars: consisting of three short beats<br>
        Tetrasemos bars: consisting of four short beats<br>
        <b class="moz-txt-star">and so on so forth.</b><br>
        <br>
        (footnote) Bars in modern music ("oi podes eis ten newteran mousiken") are called
        "meters" ("metra"). the rhythm of the Ancient Greeks was based on prosody, that
        is the distinction of syllables intro short and long. That rhythm was called prosodic.
        Modern musicians use the emphasis of the accented syllable to form the rhythm ad
        not the short and long syllables. such a rhythm is called "tonikos" ("tonistikos",
        dimitri: accent-based). It is possible ("einai de dynaton") for the rhythmic emphasis
        to coincide <b class="moz-txt-star">or not</b> with the logical, grammatical accept
        of words. In this rhyhtm, <b class="moz-txt-star">every bar consists of two or three
            syllables</b>.<br>
        <br>
        §289 Bars are categorised in simple and complex ones. Simple are Disemos and Trisemos.
        Complex are those that consist of multiplying and combining the simple ones.<br>
        <br>
        §290 The beats of the bar are not counted each with thesis and arsis, but some are
        taken in thesis and some are taken in arsis. ("oi chronou tou rhythmikou podos den
        metrountai eis ekastos me thesin kai me arsin, alla allos lambanetai eis tin thesin
        kai allos eis tin arsin"). (dimitri: direct argument against monosemos counting
        "tak tak tak").<br>
        <br>
        §291. Terminology: Tempo = Rhythmike agoge = Chronike agoge<br>
        <br>
        §292 Tempo can be indicated by either a tempo indication sign (e.g. hemiargon over
        x) or by using appropriate time-related signs on the quantity characters to extend
        or reduce the duration of quality characters in the piece.<br>
        <br>
        §293 (this is the part that is scanned on the Analogion). Rhythm consists of bars.
        The type of bars, characterises the rhythm, therefore Disemos bars form Disemos
        Rhythm, Trisemos bars form Trisemos Rhythm, Tetrasemos bars form Tetrasemos Rhythm
        and so on and so forth".<br>
        <br>
        §294 Like bars, rhythms can be simple or complex, depending on whether they consist
        of simple of complex bars.<br>
        <br>
        §295 Simple rhythms are Disemos and Trisemos. Complex rhythms are Tetrasemos, Pentasemos,
        Hexasemos, Heptasemos etc. *Ecclesiastical music, most of the time, makes use of
        Disemos, Trisemos and Tetrasemos. Ecclesiastical chants are usually chanted on the
        basis of Disemos Rhyhtm and are witten according to that.<br>
        <br>
        §296 According to Disemos rhythm, every bar consists of two equal beats, <b class="moz-txt-star">
            either simple or complex</b>. In chanting, the first beat is taken in the thesis
        and second beat is taken in the arsis. The first beat is always emphasised more
        than the second". To count this rhythm, we hit the knee once of a thesis and we
        hit the air once for an arsis. (footnote) Some modernists divide the Disemos bars
        inside the piece by small vertical lines called "Diastolai". In Byzantine Ecclesiastical
        Chants it is not allowed to use bar lines because they destroy the form and unity
        of the melos ("dioti katastrefetai i ploki kai i enotita tou melous").<br>
        <br>
        §298 The two beats of the of a Disemos bar are often represented not by two quantity
        signs but by one two-beat sign ("apo enan xaraktera dixronon") and vice-versa, instead
        of a one-beat sign, there are two half-beat characters.<br>
        <br>
        §299. In Trisemos Rhythm, each bar consists of three beats, *simple or complex*.
        In chanting, the first beat is always emphasised more than the others.... It is
        counted with one thesis and two arsis...<br>
        <br>
        §301. In Tetrasemos Rhythm, each bar consists of four beats, simple or complex.
        ... The first beat is always emphasised more than the other three, and the third
        beat is emphasised more than the second and fourth beat... It is counted with one
        thesis and three arsis...<br>
        <br>
        <span class='name'>Chapter: Ecclesiastical
            Melos and Rhythm</span><br>
        <br>
        §304. Some Eccl. chants, in terms of rhythm, follow a well defined rhythm ("orismenon
        kanonikon rhythmon") consisting of homogeneous ("omoeideis") bars. Other chants
        consist of heterogeneous ("eteroeideis') bars e.g. Disemos, Trisemos etc.<br>
        <br>
        §305. Most melodies, <b class="moz-txt-star">from those the heirmologic in particular</b>,
        don't follow a fixed rhythm ("kanonikon rhythmon") in the strict sense (according
        to the definition of rhythm above). Usually the chants in practice they follow the
        "tonikos" rhythm., and in particular the by-beat such rhythm ("akolouthousi ton
        tonikon rythmon, kai malista ton xronikon toiouton"). That is the melody is executed
        by observing the beats of each rhythmic bar ("to melos ekteleitai, tiroumenwn twn
        xronwn tou rhythmikou podos").<br>
        <br>
        <span class='name'>Fast Heirmologic Pieces and Rhythm</span><br>
        <br>
        §306. In fast Heirmologic pieces, there rarely is regular rhythm. In such chants,
        the "tonikos" (accent-based) rhythm is appropriate ("prosidiazei"). which is based
        on the accents of the words and therefore renders clearly the words and helps (dimitri:
        the listeners) in following the meaning of troparia.<br>
        <br>
        §307. In Heirmologic pieces, the grammatically emphasised syllables are represented
        by chanracters (signs) carrying one of the quality signs, like psephiston, vareia,
        omalon in particular, and *those syllables become the beginning of a bar. Mainly
        such chants are chanted in single chronos ("monosemos") alsoknown as simple chronos
        ("chronos aplous")*.<br>
        <br>
        <span class='name'>Slow Heirmologic Chants and Rhythm</span><br>
        <br>
        §308. Slow Heirmologic pieces generally follow regular ("kanonikon") rhythm. That
        is facilitated by the fact that each syllable usually lasts for 2 beats )sometimes
        more), it is therefore easy to form homogeneous rhythmic bars.<br>
        <br>
        §309. In slow Heirmologic pieces, rhythm is usually *Disemos or Tetrasemos (consisting
        of four simple beats)*. The most common tempo appropriate for melodies in Disemos
        rhythm is this "argon over x". In such pieces the performer tries to adhere to the
        following rules: the first "tic" ("ktypon") of half-second duration measures one
        simple syllable in the thesis and the second "tic" measures one simple syllable
        in the arsis. If a simple syllable has duration of one "tic" then we will spend
        one whole second on a syllable with two time "tics" (the above is related to a previous
        chapter on tempo).<br>
        <br>
        <span class='name'>Slow Sticheraric Chants and Rhythm</span><br>
        <br>
        §310. In such pieces, rhythm is either regular or, more often, mixed (that is "tonikos"),
        consisting of Disemos, Trisemos and Tetrasemos bars.<br>
        <br>
        §311. *Accented syllables become beginnings of bars (as in the heirmologic pieces).*<br>
        <br>
        §312.* Sticheraric pieces too, when chanted in the so called "simple chronos" ("chronos
        haplous") proceed smoothly without stumblic rhythmically ("xwris na proskrouwsi
        rythmikws"). However, there are also such pieces with regular rhythm, Tetrasemos
        or Disemos*.<br>
        <br>
        <span class='name'>Papadic Chants and Rhythm</span><br>
        <br>
        §313 Due to the extending of each syllable to many beats, there are formed homogeneous
        bars and therefore *regular rhythm, Disemos or Tetrasemos*.<br>
        <br>
        <span class='name'>Ancient Byzantine Pieces</span><br>
        <br>
        §314 There are a number of preserved ancient melodies in which each syllable (with
        some exceptions) is extended into four beats and constitutes a Tetrasemos bar. Such
        pieces are the following examples:<br>
        <br>
        "Fos Ilaron", "Kyrie twn Dynamewn", "Tin Pasan Elpida Mou", "Kateuthenthetw (Presanctified)",
        "Alleluia of Nymphios", "Idou o Nymphios" and others.<br>
        <br>
        <span class='name'>On changing the rhythm of melos</span><br>
        <br>
        §314 (mistake in AB's numbering). Byz. Eccl. melodies proceed from beginning to
        end with the same rhythm. Only in the kratemata of slow compositions a change of
        rhythm is indicated as "gorgon over x". This general observation applies to all
        kratemata which are usually chanted in Disemos Rhythm.<br>
        <br>
        (footnote) Despite received tradition, many modern teachers chant the kratema of
        Theotoke Parthene of Petros Bereketis in Trisemos rhythm, indicating the rhythmic
        change as "hemiargon over x gorgon over x". According to them, slow tempo ("chronike
        agoge") becomes fast tempo while one-beat characters are extended into two-beat
        ones and two-beat characters are extended into three-beat ones and thus form Trisemos
        bars. Characters with more beats are extended accordingly. This act of modernists
        is not only totally arbitrary ("authairetos") but also destroys the rules of interpretationof
        Ecclesiastical music.<br>
        <br>
        --------------------<br>
        <br>
        In another of Boudouris' books called "Mousikokritika" (p. 156) we read this very
        clear and important quote:
        <br>
        <br>
        §239 ... <span class='name'>Every piece can be chanted by-beat ("kata
            chronon") and by-rhythm ("kata rhythmon"). However, what dominates the musical melos
            of the troparion in the rhythm, which is given to it during chanting by the person
            who chants it. </span>
