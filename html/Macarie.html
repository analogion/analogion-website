                The greatest Romanian chanter and composer - <span class='name'>
                    Macarie Ieromonahul </span>- wrote many books , but many of them remained
        in manuscripts. I have seen his Irmologion-Kalofonikon,
        in the library of the Romanian Academy, there are on the whole
        hundreds of chants, all of the translations form Petros Bereketis, Balasios, Chrysaphes,
        Germanos Neon Patron and some composed by himself. They are writen in Romanian language
        but with slavonic characters, at least two thirds of the book are kratimas.<p/>
        <span class='name'>Filotheu Monahul:</span><br>
        ...the manuscript (Rom. Mss. 1685) contains the translation made by Macarie
        Ieromonahul from Gregorios' exigisis of the Irmologion Kalofonikon. It has
        added kratimas composed by Gregorios, Hurmuz, Petros Lambadarios, Georgios
        Kritos and Petros Byzantios after each Irmos. The manuscript is only a beautiful
        copy made by one of Macarie's disciples, Ilie. His original exists also in
        the Library of Roumanian Academy, and it was made in 1833, while Macarie remained
        almos one year in Neamt Monastery, where he worked together with Visarion
        Ieromonahul on some new rules of exigisis. Here i add 2 variants of exigisis made
        by Visarion Ieromonahul on Efrixe ge, by Panagiot Halatzoglu. It is from my
        first book of psaltic music, the Paisian Triodion, printed half a year ago.
