        These books <u>are still used</u> today in our orthodox monasteries, which preserved
        the psaltic tradition, without changes. About these 2 particular books:
        <br>
        <br>
        The Gramatica is the "ABC" - the manual for the psaltes; it was written in 1900,
        by a professor of psaltic music (the byzantine music was called in Romania, at these
        times, "churchly oriental music"). The professor's name was Nicolae Severeanu; he
        was a professor of Vocal Music, chanter and conductor of the Choir of the Buzau
        Episcopate (Buzau is a province in the east of Romania). The book was agreed by
        The Holy Synod of Romanian Orthodox Church in 1900, for the use of students of the
        Church-Music Highscools. Below the first page, it is written: "This is the right/property
        of the author".</div>
    <div>
        </div>
    <div>
        2.The Anastasimatarion - is entitled "The Anastasimatarion of the Holy Monastery
        of Neamt (Niamets)", written in 1943, under thePatriarch Nicodim Munteanu.
        It was written by Most Reverend Protosingel FatherVictor Ojog, graduated student
        of the Academy of Religious Music in Bucharest. It contains adapted works of Dimitrie
        Suceveanu, and works by Victor Ojog. This book was agreed by the Holy Patriarchate,
        by the Order 286/ The 21-st of February, 1942.<br>

        There are several Anastasimataria in Romanian. The most commonly used is the so-called
        "Uniform Anastasimatar" which is written in both psaltic and linear notation in
        two volumes (Vol.1 Vespers, Vol.2 Matins). Until recently it was the only one readily
        available.

    Without even looking at the scanned texts, Suceveanou is a VERY credible author.
    Back then (1800s), Rumania was still a Metropolis, and he was the protopsaltis.
    He went ot Constantinople to learn the new system by Gregorios Protopsaltis. I think
    he stayed there for 4 or more years. He returned to Rumania where he set out to
    transcribe all notation melodies into the new system. There were some "textual "    problems, but they were corrected more for THEOLOGICAL reasons than for musical
    adaptation reasons. I've studied quite a few pieces of this man's transcriptions.
    Where he can, he uses the CLASSICAL Greek formulae, because the TONIC formular patterns
    MATCH quite well. Otherwise, he still uses Classical Forlulae Equivalents where
    the tonic sequences don't match. In some cases, he has to come up with NEW formulae
    so as to compensate for formulae that are INEXISTENT in Greek, or that would sound
    too "heavy" in the Rumanian language. He is the best adapatator in Rumanian I know
    of. Later editions are "allaxophotised", just as Zoi has "alloxophotised" Ioannis'
    Heirmologion, which is an "alloxophotisation" of Ephesios' version of Petros...
    I made reference to Suceveanu's work in my previous postings. Congratulations and
    many thanks for those who took the time to put this remarkable work up for everyone's
    benefit. Here is a PROTOPSALTIS of GREAT competence who used CONSERVATIVE methods,
    always based on OTHER TRADITIONAL psaltis = of Constantinople.... PRETENDING to
    go back to "hieroglyphics" is like trying to substitute all these great men's knowledge,
    talent AND PRUDENCE.... And today's hieroglyphic PRETENDERS are just like circus
    CLOWNS, trying to draw attention by waving and gesturing, when they cannot even
    chant one, SINGLE melody STRAIGHT... So, if you're Rumanian, get back to basics
    by studying Suceveanu..... and forget the "hieroglyphics"..<br>

    Suceveanu was indeed a great cantor and composer, along with Anton Pan, Stefanache
    Popescu, Ion Popescu-Pasarea and a few others (Severeanu, Varlaam etc.) . I saw
    some years ago his Idiomelar and it is very good indeed. The Uniform Anastasimatar
    is a 20th century publication and aimed at uniforming psaltic art in Romanian churches.
    Its transcriptions are not too bad though they are a bit odd at times. An
    interesting feature of that Romanian Anastasimatarion is that the Saturday Vespers
    Prokeimenon is chanted not in its standard mode but in the mode of the week. As
    an appendix it contains the most common prosomoia.<br>

    The classical Romanian Anastasimatarion might be considered the one of Macarie Ieromonahul
    (Vienna, 1823), a very close adaptation of the Anastasimatarion edited by Petros
    Ephesios. It was reedited with minor modifications in 1856, 1875, 1897, and more
    recently in 2002, and served as the basis of other Romanian Anastasimataria printed
    in the 19th and 20th centuries. The first one of these was Dimitrie Suceveanu's
    (1848); it contained chants from Macarie's book together with others adapted into
    Romanian by Suceveanu himself (from the new Anastasimataria edited in 1839 and/or
    1846 and Mousiki Melissa, 1847), and very few which are his own compositions. Almost
    all Romanian Anastasimataria edited after 1850 had as source at least one of the
    following Anastasimataria: Macarie's, Suceveanu's and Pann's, the last one being
    published in 1847 (Prescurtare din Bazul muzicii bisericesti si din Anastasimatar).
    The new composers embellished and/or shortened the chants written by the aforementioned
    3 chanters. Suceveanu was more influential in Moldavia, and Pann in Wallachia. The
    Anastasimatarion on your site was published by Victor Ojog. It is 95% the one of
    Suceveanu, but also includes some chants by Nicolae (Nae) Severeanu (the last stichiron
    of the Lauds of the first plagal mode). Some of the stichoi after the Kekragarion
    in the same mode owed to Pann. Ojog's book has been reprinted twice after 1990.
    There are some uninspired modifications in the new editions (they tried to fit the
    1943 melody to a better translation) so the old one is preferable. The new editions
    were used in a few chant schools.<br>
    <br>
    Concerning Suceveanu's life, I would like to add something to what Georgie wrote.
    Born in 1816, he couldn't have Gregorios Protopsaltis as a teacher. My<br>
    opinion is that Gregorios is mistaken by another psaltis with the same name (Gregorios
    Vyzantios), which was active in Iasi from about 1816 to 1842, when he died. 
    don't know about any evidence that Suceveanu traveled to Constantinople; he had
    as teachers two Greeks (Gregorios Vyzantios, Gregorios Paraskiadis) and one Romanian
    (Nicu Dimcea jr.).

    The Romanian Anastasiamatarion is not Suceveanu's but Victor Ojog (can see it in
    the first page). Actually Dimitrie Suceveanu was a great Romanian protopsalti and
    maistor who lived in the 19th century (in Iasi) and, along with Macarie The Hieromonk,
    it is one of the founders of Romanian psaltic music (they translated a lot of music
    from Greek to Romanian, also they created some new, original chants and also they
    have translated some of the work of the Great Maistores from the old system to the
    new Hrisanthic one.
