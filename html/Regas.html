        One should read the introduction of this Typikon, if I find time I'll scan it. Papa
        Rigas' Typikon is based on St. Sava's Typikon and takes into account Athonite Typika
        (which are a branch of Savaitic Typikon), probably also local customs on Skiathos
        (I haven't studied this). As far as its place is concerned, I think it can be safely
        used by the monasteries, but also in the parish practice (with adaptations that
        e.g. you won't have a vigil every Sunday etc). Rigas' Typikon is very analytical
        since he supplemented it with his own comments and explanations and I like it. It
        doesn't have Violakis' numerous concessions (where do you find in it provisions
        for the vigil, double Gospel readings, double koinonika, stichologia of the Biblical
        odes, correct way of chanting canons, correct way of chanting troparia and kontakia
        after the little entrance etc etc etc?) and a plethora of shortcomings (this is
        really a separate chapter).<br>

        Fr. Rigas' typikon is unique in what it gives a detailed description of services
        for every day of the year, not just for red letter Saints and Feasts. Its
        applicability nowdays is a different matter altogether, especially in parishes
        churches. In modern parish practice the Violakis Typikon is so strong
        that its errors can be amended only by force (e.g. some synodal encyclical).
        The book is still available and worth buying.<br>

        It is. It was published by Vlatadon with a preface by Foundoulis. It's a bit pricy,
        40 euros, and there's also the second volume, Zitimata Typikou (short essays on
        various liturgical issues), which is 15 euros. Though two books are completely independent.
        The Typikon is very analytical and I like it.<br>
