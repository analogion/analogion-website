        "Archon" means "leader" or "leading". There are a few types of "Archontes".
            To be an "Archon" means to have been officially tonsured by the Ecumenical Patriarchate.
            The honour itself is also called an "offikion" in other words a "recognition of
            status or achievement".<br>
        <br>
        <span class='name'>Archons or Archontes Psaltai of the Great Church of
            Christ </span>(or of the Ecumenical Patriarchate): These are the four main psaltai
        of the Patriarchal church. The two psaltai of the right choir are called <b>Archon Protopsaltis
        </b>(the main psaltis) and <b>Archon First Domestikos</b> (his helper). The two
        psaltai of the left choir are called <b>Archon Lambadarios</b> (the main psaltis)
        and <b>Archon Second Domestikos </b>(his helper). The leading young psaltis
        of the right choir is called Protocanonarchos (but he is not an Archon). A
        full list of Archontes Protopsaltai, Lambadarioi and Domestikoi is given in Angelos
        Boudouris' article in Orthodoxia Magazine (1937) available on Analogion [<a href="../pdf/Angelos_Boudouris_Oi_Mousikoi_Xoroi_Tis_MXE.pdf">pdf</a>,        7Mb].<br>

        <div align="justify">
            <span style="font-style: italic;">Notes by Dr. Alexander Lingas:</span><br>
            Archons in what used to be the Archdiocese of North and South America are indeed
            archons of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, just not of the same 'order' as those in
            Europe. The order of those in the USA is that of St Andrew (see <a                 href="http://www.archons.org/archons/">http://www.archons.org/archons/</a> 
            ), whereas those in Greece (if I remember correctly) are of St Mary Pammakaristos.
            Now that Canada is an independent metropolis answering directly to the Ecumenical
            Patriarchate, I'm not sure about where there archons belong. A number of Greek Orthodox
            liturgical musicians who work in polyphony in addition to or instead of chant have
            received Patriarchal offikia. The conductor, composer and musicologist Frank Desby
            was an Archon Lampadarios, as is the composer/conductor Tikey Zes. You can find
            a full list of current archons on page 140 of the following file <a                 href="http://www.goarch.org/en/archdiocese/yearbook/pdf/2006.pdf">http://www.goarch.org/.http://2006.pdf</a>
            Curiously, Ketsetzis is not listed here, but I found a few more Lampadarioi:<br>
            <br>
            Tykye Camaras, Lambadarios<br>
            Elias D. Chinonis, Lambadarios<br>
            Philip N. Christopher, Lambadarios<br>
            <br>
            There are also a few church singers hiding out among the other titles, for example:<br>
            <br>
            Theodore Bogdanos, Hartoularios<br>
            George T. Demos, Aktouarios<br>
            Thomas M. Pallad, Hartophylax<br>
