In his preface to the Heirmologion published in 1838 in Constantinople, Ioannis Protopsaltis writes the following:
"Becasue some musicians are chanting out without correct stresses ("paratonws") and overlook commas and
periods, they don't pronounce the words and their meanings naturally,
for that reason I modified not only accents of the words suitably
according to the commas and periods, but also I improved the pieces
according to the way they are already chanted in the Great Church". From this statement it appears,
that Ioannis Protopsaltis acknowledges that he modified melos of Petros Lampadarios transcribed by
Gregorios Protopsaltis and Chourmouzios Chartophylax. At the same time, he claims that (at least part)
of his modifications reflect the contemporary tradition of the Patriarchal church (i.e. the tradition
of Konstantinos Protopsaltis). According to Angelos Boudouris, Archon Domestikos of the Great Church,
his teacher Iakovos Nafpliotis never used Ioannis' Heirmologion when chanting, and didn't approve of its innovations.
In this page, using the comparison with existing old recordings from the first half of the 20th c., we will verify, whether
everything that Ioannis Protopsaltis did were indeed innovations, or he also reflected the
tradition of Konstantinos Protopsaltis, which was also transmitted by other students of the latter, e.g.
Nikolaos Lampadarios, teacher of Iakovos Nafpliotis.
