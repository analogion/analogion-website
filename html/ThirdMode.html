<div class="question">
Most theory books call Third Mode "Enharmonic". Simon Karas calls it "Hard Diatonic" instead for the first time in his Theory book. Why? </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">Y. Bilalis</span>:
    These are the misnomers that happened during the 19th century
    development of the Chrysanthine notation along with the influences that
    they had from the Enlightenment era. The Patriarchal Committee 1881 (7
    cantors/musicians gathered in Constantinople at that time with
    president the Archimandrite Germanos Afthonides [ the Ottoman empire
    used the name Constantinople till 1905, when it was changed into
    Istanbul!! ]) decided to use the term "enharmonic" probably from their
    overzeal to show that the byzantine chant had a direct relationship
    with the theory of ancient greek music and shared all three genre that
    are described from the 7 Harmonic teachers. So, they appointed 3rd mode
    and barys into the "enharmonic" genre. One other possible reason for
    that 1881 decision (I was not there that time) might be that the
    interval ke-Zo' was less than halftone in chanting practice, and so by
    theory whatever was less than a halftone should have a flavour of
    enharmonic; this is another attempt to deepen into their thinking.
    Going back to their theory, the intervals of 3rd mode and/or barys
    (heirmologic/sticheraric) are Ga(F) - Di(G) =12 [full tone], Di(G) -
    Ke(A) = 12, and Ke(A) - Zo'(B)= 5.5 (6). These are the intervals of
    piano major scale which in the terminology of ancient Greek music is
    called diatonon suntonon (=hard); unfortunately the 1881 committee (pg.
    46) changed the terminology into "enharmonic" for this 4chord. At the
    same time, the 1881 committee did not specify that the plagal of 4th
    and 4th modes as well as First and its plagal belong to another sibling
    of the Diatonical genre, the soft diatonic one (with intervals 12,10,8
    in any order [=between the piano cracks], but simply stated that these
    4 modes belong to the diatonic genre. So, probably they wanted to be
    general in their terminology and appointed the modes 1st-plagal 1st and
    4th-plagal 4th into the DIATONIC genre whereas the 3rd-barys into the ENHARMONIC genre.

    <div class="question">
        Why are some pieces of Third mode chanted with soft diatonic intervals by some psaltai even though there is no diatonic fthora of NH on GA?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        See special page which is a performance analysis of the Exaposteilarion "Ton Nymfona Sou Vlepo" [<a href="ThirdModeDiatonicEnharmonic.html">html</a>]</div>    <div class="question">
        Why do Papadic pieces of Third mode have the fthora of diatonic NH on GA? Are they meant to be chanted with diatonic or enharmonic (hard diatonic precisely) intervals?</div>

    <div class="question">
    How many ways are there to chant a piece that is prescribed as Third Mode?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        For most pieces, there is no doubt, only one way: hard diatonic intervals. For other pieces like "Ton Nymfona Sou" there appear to be two ways.</div>
    <div class="question">
    What apechema should be done in pieces of Third mode</div>
    <div class="answer">
        The simplest one is a plain "Ne" on GA. The old apechema of the mode is "Nana" (there exist short and long versions of it which are considered classical, see Mega Theoretikon of Chrysanthos. There is no really long apechema for the papadic pieces as there is for instance in other Authentic modes. Ioannidis [Theoretikon] gives a complex apechema of his own.</div>
