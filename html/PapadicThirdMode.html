    <div class="question">
    Why is the diatonic fthora of NH placed on the basis GA of such compositions?
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer">
    Papadic pieces of Third mode are notated with the diatonic fthora of NH on GA and
        theory books say that they "progress as in Plagal Fourth mode". However, when we
        hear them chanted by traditional psaltai they sound like Third mode. Why then put
        the fthora of NH there?</div>
