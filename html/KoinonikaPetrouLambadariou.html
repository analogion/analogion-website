    <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis</span>: This piece is indicated with the hard
    chromatic fthora not to change the intervals into hard chromatic but to denote that
    the mode moves like a Plagal (although an Authentic mode) that is from low pitches
    to eventually high pitches. For that reason, the psalti should choose a relatively
    low pitch as base for this one. Other than that, one could have indicated this piece
    as normal second mode from DI with the soft chromatic fthora (as with most modern
    compositions of this style) and ignore all other fthorai inside the piece. The soft
    chromatic and hard chromatic fthroai in this piece have no effect of the intervals,
    they are there just to indicate the movement of the melos or to remind the psalti
    to do certain melodic attractions. The latter is the case on the second page, where
    the diatonic fthora of NH is placed to signify a melodic attraction (elxis) that
    reminds of the effect of kliton (ZW sharp, KE sharp). A confusing example of the
    above case where a soft chromatic fthora is used is on the second last line of the
    first page. What is the fthora used there for? To take us back from hard chromatic
    to soft chromatic? But we already know that the hard chromatic fthora that precedes
    it, has not effect on the intervals (or does it)? Then why the fthora? If it wasn't
    there, one might be tempted to hit that GA note higher that required (thinking that
    it corresponds to the hard chromatic GA of Plagal Second mode). The soft chromatic
    fthora could act as a reminder that this GA should be natural (that is not raised),
    exactly as if it was a ZW of our familiar Second mode from DI. Is that the whole
    truth though? The ison of the piece could be a continuous DI throughout, with possibly
    an exception on the second page where it ends on NH with a martyria to indicate
    a cadence. There the isokrates can follow melos. Notice how the piece does not do
    cadences on low ZW at all (what we would now call BOY of Second Mode - with a base
    of DI) which makes it somehow different than other pieces of Second mode (e.g. the
    Sticheraric ones). The first part of the composition, up to the first martyria of
    PA can be thought of as the Prooimion (Prelude) for which Chrysanthos comments it
    can be chanted without a steady rhythm, a gentle introduction into the mode and
    its special intervals.

    G. K. Michalakis' performance (below) is in agreement with the above observations.
    Georgios allows himself some rhythmic freedom in many places in the piece, a typical
    characteristic of chanting Papadic (slow) compositions. In the same performance,
    notice how Georgios breaks the piece into small phrases with well defined start
    and finish allowing him to restore his breath and to not bore the listeners with
    a continuous stream of neverending notes. Sometimes Georgios accentuates the beats
    often in an exaggerated manner. This, when not overdone, gives emphasis and life
    to the piece.
