                About the school<a href="..#News"></a></h4>
            <div align="justify">
                The Holy Archdiocese of Australia, with the blessing
                    of His Eminence, has founded an official school of Byzantine Music (Psalmody), the
                    first of its kind in Australia. An initiative of the first chanter (“Protopsaltis”)
                    of the Cathedral of the Annunciation of the Virgin (Redfern, Sydney) Mr. Asterios
                    Zouriakas, the school operates as part of the Theological College of St. Andrews,
                    however, it admits whoever interested, not just the college’s students. It consists
                    of a three year course, after which a diploma will be issued to the students, authorised
                    and recognised by the Archdiocese of Australia. The main focus
                of the school is the training of new chanters who eventually will occupy the chanting
                stands (psalteria) in our churches. At the same time it will contribute to the artistic
                development of practising chanters and will act as a point of reference with respect
                to upholding our ecclesiastical musical tradition. The school accept students of
                all ages and both sexes on the condition that they pass the appropriate entry exams.
               Apart from Mr Zouriakas, the teaching staff includes
                    diploma holders Mr. Dimitri Koubaroulis (the left chanter “Lambadarios” of the Cathedral)
                    , Deacon Gerasimos Koutsouras (former first chanter “Protopsaltis” of St Sophia) and Mr Vasilios Psyllacos (first chanter "Protopsaltis" of St Andrew). All teachers' contributions to this effort are on a voluntary basis. Lessons are given in both English and Greek, however chanting is always
                    done in Greek for the time being.
                  
                <br>
                The shool started operating officially on the 7th of March 2005.
