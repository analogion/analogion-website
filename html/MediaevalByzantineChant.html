        Probably the earliest attempts to transcribe the mediaeval repertory in an analytical
        notation were made by Petros Lambadarios. His train of thought was followed by Gregorios
        Protopsaltis and Chourmouzios Chartophylax who transcribed a large deal of mediaeval
        compositions, including the Papadike and the Sticherarion. The main characteristic
        of their work is the assumption that the so-called signs of great hypostases represent
        the whole melodic lines and consequently the assumption that the mediaeval scores
        were written in a concise manner and require a thorough, long exegesis. The best
        known earliest example of long exegesis is the exegesis of the Nekrosemon Trisagion
        done by Balasios the Priest (17th c.). The practice of long exegesis is well-documented
        in the 18th c. and contrary to the opinions of early Western researchers of the
        Byzantine chant (Tillyard, Wellesz, Strunk...) it's not the invention of the Three
        teachers: they did what their predecessors did in the 18th c. There is an early
        18th c. ms discovered by Prof. Stathis with transcriptions to the Western notation
        which unambiguously attests to the fact of existence of the long exegesis. The person
        to systematise the theory of long exegesis was Konstantinos Psachos, who mainly
        relied on the work of Panagiotis Kiltzanidis. The elements of the theory of long
        exegesis can be found in Chrysanthos' Great Theoretikon and Kyriakos Filoxenis'
        Lexikon of the Ecclesiastic music. Psachos' ideas were met with opposition not only
        in the West, but also within the Patriarchate, his main opponent being Markos Vasileiou.
        In 1930s the Western researchers reached the general consensus on how to reconstruct
        the mediaeval Byzantine chant: the great hypostases were essentially discarded in
        transcriptions, the second and plagal second modes were assumed to be diatonic,
        the Western notation sufficient to represent microtonal nuances and the rhythm similar
        to that empolyed in transcriptions of mediaeval Gregorian chant done by Solesme
        abbey monks. The received Greek tradition was declared to be corrupted by oriental
        influences and the sole source used were the mediaeval mss and theoretical treatises,
        which can however provide only a limited amount of information. At about this time
        then still a young musicologist Simon Karas enters the scene. It took him some time
        to formulate his views, but according to him the Western transcriptions were wrong.
        However he accepted that the long exegesis of the mediaeval repertory wasn't the
        only possibility, especially in case of the Sticherarion and offered his method
        of transcription. In 1960s the MMB, the foundation to study the Byzantine chant
        established by Hoeg, Tillyard and Wellesz stopped publishing the transcriptions
        evidently due to ceratin inconsistencies they encountered. At about this time an
        article on the analysis of the sticheron Ton ilion krypsanta by Gregorios Stathis
        was published in Studies in Eastern chant, the main Western journal on the Byzantine
        musicology. This article marks a change in Western attitude toward the received
        tradition of the Byzantine chant and many Western musicologists and notably J. Raasted
        start to admit that a diachronic approach has to be used. Stathis became the main
        exponent of the stenographic theory (i.e. the theory of long exegesis). Another
        Greek scholar G. Amargianakis claimed that through his study of the mediaeval Sticherarion
        and cataloguing its formulae he reached the conclusion that the stenographic theory
        was indeed true. As far as modern research in Greece is concerned, following Karas'
        ideas several new generation musicologists, and especially Ioannis Arvanitis, question
        the fact that the long exegesis was the only possibility and talk about short exegesis
        of the mediaeval Byzantine repertory.<br>
