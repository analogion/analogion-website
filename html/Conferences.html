        "Byzantine Musical Culture" conference</div>
    <div class="text">
        In collaboration with the Byzantine Studies Initiative of the University of Pittsburgh
        and with the organisational collaboration and support of the European Arts Center
        (EUARCE), we announce the First International Conference of the Society entitled
        "Byzantine Musical Culture". The Conference is dedicated, in memoriam, to St-John
        Chrysostom, one of the pivotal Fathers of Christianity, 1600 years since his passing.
        <p />
        The Conference will be held at the state-of-the-art Conference Center of the Athens
        Information Technology Center between September 10-15, 2007 in Attica, Greece. All
        musical and artistic events will be held at the proximal Paeanea Center. Complimentary
        luxury minibus shuttle will serve the participants between the venues and the proximal
        Hotel Akraion, which will accomodate all participants.
        <p />
        Athens is the main attraction in the prefecture of Attica and serving as Greece's
        historical center offers a unique setting for the scholar and musicologist including
        numerous sites of archaeological interest, museums, libraries and ecclesiastic locations.
        Paeanea is a unique and tranquil setting with much to offer to the historian and
        the archaeology scholar.
        <p />
        Abstract submission deadline is July 31st, 2007<br>
