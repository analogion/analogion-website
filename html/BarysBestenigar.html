        Introduction</div>
    <div class="text">
        In the past 250 years (and possibly earlier) there have been a number of Ecclesiastical
        compositions known to belong in a special type of Barys Diatonic Mode which is often
        identified as Barys Tetraphonos or maqam Bestenigar by some psaltai. The earliest
        well known composition that we know of in this mode is a doxology of Iakovos Protopsaltis
        in late 18th century
        <div class="image">

            (scanned from Mousike Pandekte, 1850, vol 2, click for original size)</div>
        According to most of the -relatively few- Byzantine theoreticians that talk about
        this mode, Barys Tetraphonos uses the "diatonic scale" where DI is flattened temporarily
        or permanently (throughout the piece) and ZW is also flattened sometimes as in other
        diatonic modes. Since no mention is made about GA, one assumes that GA is meant
        to be performed natural. Indeed, this theory corresponds exactly to the way maqam
        Bestenigar is performed today in secular (external) music. However, this theory
        does not correspond to modern psaltic practice. In all recorded performances of
        such pieces, Barys Tetraphonos does not use "the diatonic scale". It uses "a diatonic
        scale" of its own which requires new theory to describe it. Some theoreticians,
        Konstantinos Psahos being the first of them, already tried to present such a new
        theory in the past but their views appear incomplete and sometimes incorrect. In
        this page, we examine the history of the issue, the different theories and compositions
        from both Ecclesiastical and Secular repertoire and we attempt to draw conclusions
        regarding questions such as:
        <ul>
            <li>When does Barys Tetraphonos appear in Ecclesiastical music?</li>
            <li>Why do most chant theoreticians not talk about Barys Tetraphonos?</li>
            <li>Why do even modern theoreticians present an incorrect theory about this mode?</li>
            <li>Are there more than one type of Barys Tetraphonos in Ecclesiastical music?</li>
            <li>Why is Barys Tetraphonos different than modern maqam Bestenigar?</li>
            <li>Could maqam Bestenigar have been the same as Barys Tetraphonos in the past?</li>
            <li>Are papadic pieces of Barys Diatonic meant to be chanted in Barys Tetraphonos?</li>
            <li>What do the chromatic fthorai mean in pieces of Barys Diatonic?</li>
            <li>Is Barys Tetraphonos an Authentic (Kyrios) or Plagal mode?</li>
            <li>What is the apechema of Barys Tetraphonos?</li>
            <li>How should Barys Tetraphonos be notated in scores?</li>
            <li>and more...</li>
        </ul>
        We support our conclusions with as many scores and recordings of this mode as we
        could find.</div>
    <div class="heading">
        Maqam Bestenigar in Secular (External) Music</div>
    <div class="text">
        Maqam Bestenigar is a well known and popular maqam in "external" (non-Ecclesiastical)
        music. The following excerpt from K. Signell's book "Makam: Modal Practice in Turkish
        Art Music" contains the currently accepted scale of this maqam [<a href="../pdf/Signell-Bestenigar.pdf">pdf</a>,        72 Kb]. The maqam is a combination of maqam Iraq (or Arak) and maqam Sabah "sitting"        on top of it. The melodies make use mostly of maqam Sabah and they only make cadences
        to Iraq every now and then. The interval ZW-GA in this maqam is an imperfect fifth
        interval which is what gives this maqam its special character. This theory agrees
        with instrumental practice as shown by the following two recordings:

        The Modal Martyria of Barys Tetraphonos in Ecclesiastical Scores</div>
    <div class="text">
        Ecclesiastical compositions thought to be written in this maqam are labelled with
        inconsistently different names in the literature. Here is a list of different indications
        we have seen or heard about pieces of Barys Tetraphonos. Examples scanned from scores
        can be found in the analysis that follows.
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Plain Modal martyria of Barys Diatonic with no other sign/indication</li>
        <li>Barys Diatonic (with/without modal martyria of Barys)</li>
        <li>Barys Tetraphonos (with/without modal martyria of Barys)</li>
        <li>Bestenigar (with/without modal martyria of Barys)</li>
        <li>A four note ascent sign next to the modal martyria at the top of the piece (e.g.
            in Gregorios' case [<a href="../images/Doxologia_Gregoriou_Barys_Tetraphonos.jpg">jpg</a>],            from "Mousike Pandekte" [reference pending]) </li>
        <li>Placing a permanent flat crossed sign on DI at the beginning of the piece (e.g.
            in Gregorios Protopsaltis' Axion Estin ([<a href="http://anemi.lib.uoc.gr/php/pdf_pager.php?filename=/var/www/tkl-portal-neo//metadata/0/8/8/attached-metadata-06-0000088/168620_04.pdf&pageno=453&width=368&height=596&maxpage=904&lang=en">html</a>,
            page 453] (from anemi.lib.uoc) </li>
        <li>Repeating simple (uncrossed) flat signs on DI througout the piece like for example
            in one of the most respected classical books "Mousike Pandekte" [reference pending]
            in the Doxology of Iakovos Protopsaltis [<a href="../images/Doxologia_Iakovou_Barys.jpg">jpg</a>].</li>        <li>A textual comment saying that the mode is Barys Diatonic where the pitch of GA should
            be "always sharp" [<a href="../images/BarysTetraphonos-Misaelidis-Nektarios-KaliphonosAidon-p93.jpg">jpg</a>]</li>    </ul>
    <div class="text">
        From the above descriptions, only the last one gives a hint about the pitch of GA
        in performance.
    </div>
    <div class="heading">
        Barys Tetraphonos: An Authentic ("Kyrios") or Plagal ("Plagios") Mode?</div>
    <div class="text">
        Without a GA sharp in its scale (8-12-10-8-12-12-10) we have a non-conventional
        scale where the basis note does not have an octave relationship with its Heptaphonia
        (the upper end of the scale) and which is 4 moria short of a perfect Diapason scale
        (68 instead of 72 moria). Adding the missing 4 moria by assuming GA sharp a permanent
        part of its scale, then the Mode has a typical Plagal scale with two diatonic tetrachords
        disjunct by a major (12) tone. This agrees with the general perception of Barys
        acting as Plagal Third Mode and with the theoretical rule that only a Plagal Mode
        can have a Tetraphonos special sub-mode. However, Barys Tetraphonos is special in
        that, although it is called Tetraphonos, it does not seem to correspond to an Authentic
        Mode, as happens with the Tetraphonos' branches of all other Plagal modes. We are
        not sure why this is like that.</div>
    <div class="heading">
        Barys Tetraphonos: Is GA ever natural in this mode?</div>
    <div class="text">
        When the melody reaches GA from below and descends, it seems there is more or less
        agreement between theoreticians (and oral practice from what it seems) that GA "returns"        to its natural (un-sharpened) position (e.g. see Simon Karas' "Theoretikon", vol
        I. p. 337). However, in practice, the musical scores often indicate special chromatic
        fthorai in such melodic passages to show that even then GA is sharp sometimes. The
        rest is left to the experience of the psaltis.

        Other compositions in Barys Tetraphonos differ from the above in that DI flat is
        rarely or never notated and the melodic movement is somewhat (but not a lot) different.
        For instance, DI flats do not appear at all in the Polyeleos "Logon Agathon" of
        Georgios Kres [<a href="../pdf/Polyeleos_GKretos_BarysTetraphonos_Pandekte1851.pdf">pdf</a>,        1.5 Mb] as they do in Iakovos' doxology - which by the way was probably written
        down originally by the same Georgios Kres. Some DI flats are notated in the version
        of Georgios Kres' "Logon Agathon" published by Petros Ephesios in his Anthologia
        (see examples below). In terms of oral tradition, the mode is interpreted exactly
        the same as the above recordings of the doxologies in Barys Tetraphonos. To prove
        this, we superimposed two such pieces by Stanitsas and Sfikas after transposing
        the base pitch of one of the recordings to match the other [<a href="../mp3/StanitsasSfikas-BarysTetraphonos-Comparison.mp3">mp3</a>,        2.5 Mb]. Here are the relevant scores and recordings:

        The History of Barys Tetraphonos and Bestenigar</div>
    <div class="text">
        Barys Tetraphonos as a name is mentioned since the Byzantine times and chanted as
        part of <span class="name">Ioannis Koukouzelis</span>' Mega Ison of Papadike (between
        12-14th centuries) [<a href="../images/BarysTetraphonos-MegaIson-Koukouzelis.jpg">jpg</a>]        (scanned from Agathangelos Kyriazidis "En Anthos Ecclesiastikes Mousikes", reprinted
        by Regopoulos). However, this Tetraphonos the way it is written and chanted is totally
        different to the Barys Diatonic Tetraphonos that we understand today by that name.
        Clearly here we are talking about the Tetraphonos of the so-called "Enharmonic"        Barys from GA, which sounds like Plagal Fourth from GA. Listen to the sample of
        the excertpt above by the Maistores choir directed by Prof. Gregorios Stathis [<a
            href="../mp3/BarysTetraphonos-MegaIsonPapadikis_Maistores_GStathis.mp3">mp3</a>, 950Kb].    </div>
    <div class="text">
        A few centuries later, at the end of the 18th century, <span class="name">Apostolos
            Konstas</span> presents the first theoretical evidence of Barys Tetraphonos
        as we know it, as a separate modal branch of Barys Diatonic. Apostolos gives a sample
        score (see below) that seems to be identical to what we call Barys Tetraphonos today.
        It is not clear to us yet as to what the fthorai mean at the beginning of the piece.
        It is surprising why the Three Teachers (Chrysanthos and Chourmouzios in particular),
        the Patriarchal Committee of 1881-83 and following theoreticians until Boudouris
        (with the exception of Georgios Lesvios who mentioned it in 1840 with a different
        name) chose to ignore this modal branch in their theoretical works (even though
        the mode was clearly present (and mentioned) in musical scores such as the manuscripts
        of Gregorios Protopsaltis, official Patriarchal scores such as the Pandekte of Stephanos
        and Ioannis, 1850 and elsewhere.

    <div class="text">
        At the same time as Apostolos (late 18th century), <span class="name">Iakovos Protopsaltis</span>
        composed his famous Doxology in Barys Tetraphonos.[<a href="../images/Doxologia_Iakovou_Barys.jpg">jpg</a>]        (scanned from Mousike Pandekte, 1850, vol 2). At least in Mousike Pandekte there
        is no special indication that this mode is indeed Tetraphonos except for the explicit
        flattening of DI at many places and the movement of the melody.</div>
    <div class="text">
        Another theoretician of the Old Method, <span class="name">Vasileios Stephanidis</span>,
        writes in 1819 about Barys Tetraphonos as it is found in Koukouzelis' Mega Ison,
        however he doesn't describe the Barys Tetraphonos we are interested in here. This
        could be an indication that either Stephanidis did not know much about this mode
        which could possibly be because this mode was introduced in Ecclesiastical Music
        around the end of the 18th century.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        A few years later, in early 19th century, the <span class="name">Three Teachers</span>
        did not mention Barys Tetraphonos in their theoretical works. However, they did
        write and publish pieces in Barys Tetraphonos (Gregorios' Axion Estin and Doxology/Chourmouzios'
        Second Stasis of the Typika) and in maqam "Bestenigar" (Gregorios) using notation
        identical to the Ecclesiastical pieces of Barys Diatonic. Here are some examples
        of the relevant work of the Three Teachers on the subject:</div>
    <div class="item-lessmargin">
        <span class="name">Gregorios Protopsaltis</span> wrote a "Kiari" (mathema of external
        music) [<a href="../images/Barys-Bestenigar-Gregorios-Kiari.jpg">jpg</a>, 50 Kb] labelled        Bestenigar and presented as Barys Diatonic where DI is permanently flattened with
        a crossed flat sign at the beginning of the piece and similarly, high ZW is also
        flattened with a crossed flat sign on KE. Fr. Ierotheos' choice of (later added)
        isokratema shows that he considers some phrases to be chanted with GA sharp (those
        where ison is ZW) and some with GA natural (where ison is PA) as First Mode Diphonos.
        Gregorios uses exactly the same notation for his Axion Estin which is labelled "Barys
        Tetraphonos" in Mousike Pandekte ([<a href="http://anemi.lib.uoc.gr/php/pdf_pager.php?filename=/var/www/tkl-portal-neo//metadata/0/8/8/attached-metadata-06-0000088/168620_04.pdf&pageno=453&width=368&height=596&maxpage=904&lang=en">html</a>,
        page 453] (from anemi.lib.uoc). We find it hard to believe that the Ecclesiasticpieces
        are meant to be chanted in different modes, however, lacking recordings, we cannot
        be sure. Gregorios also wrote a Doxology in the same mode, however using a slightly
        different notation with explicit flat signs on DI and different starting modal sign
        (4 note ascent instead of mentioning the word "Tetraphonos" [<a href="../images/Doxologia_Gregoriou_Barys_Tetraphonos.jpg">jpg</a>].    </div>
    <div class="item-lessmargin">
        <span class="name">Chourmouzios Chartophylax</span> composed the katavasiai of Pentecost
        in Barys Tetraphonos [<a href="../zip/Chourmouzios-Katabasiai-Barys.zip">zip</a>] (from        his Anastasimatarion, 1832) which Georgios Lesvios calls Bestenigar a few years
        later in 1840 (see below). In 1830, Chourmouzios published the book "Euterpe" ([<a
            href="http://anemi.lib.uoc.gr/metadata/9/8/e/metadata-114-0000009.tkl">html</a>]
        available from Anemi digital library) and <span class="name">Theodoros Phokaeus</span>
        published the book "Pandora" with a number of external music compositions (with
        Turkish lyrics) under the section of maqam Bestenigar. All pieces are labelled as
        Barys Diatonic without any extra discrimination, except of course for the label
        "Bestenigar" on top of them. Looking at the compositions one would think that they
        are chanted exactly as any other Barys Tetraphonos composition, Ecclesiastical or
        not. The common characteristics of "Ecclesiastical" Barys Tetraphonos appear here
        too.
        <ol>
            <li>DI and ZW are inconsistently notated flat. For instance, at the beginning of this
                piece [<a href="../images/Euterpe-Bestenigar-Barys.jpg">jpg</a>] DI is notated flat only at                one occurence but not at others leaving us in doubt as to whether DI is flat everywhere.
                Seems that the answer to this is yes and it is left to the experience of the interpreter
                to do the right intervals and the occasional flat sign is there to "remind". </li>
            <li>GA is notated but possibly not chanted always natural and it is often required to
                be sharp in some cases (regardless of melodic movement) either via the soft [<a href="../images/Euterpe-Bestenigar-Barys-GaSharp.jpg">jpg</a>]                (b) or hard chromatic [<a href="../images/Euterpe-Bestenigar-Barys-GaSharp-GaNatural.jpg">jpg</a>]                (a) fthora, the chroa of Zygos [<a href="../images/Euterpe-Bestenigar-Barys-GaSharp-2.jpg">jpg</a>]                (a) or even explicitly with a sharp sign [<a href="../images/Pandora-BarysBestenigar-GaSharp.jpg">jpg</a>]                (a). </li>
            <li>In other cases GA is probably meant to chanted natural e.g. here [<a href="../images/Euterpe-Bestenigar-Barys-GaSharp.jpg">jpg</a>]                (a) and here [<a href="../images/Euterpe-Bestenigar-Barys-GaSharp-GaNatural.jpg">jpg</a>]                (b). </li>
            <li>There is also the occasional enharmonic fthora on high ZW exactly as in the Ecclesiastical

        <span class="name">Petros Ephesios</span> in his Anthologia [18xx, reprinted by
        the Greek Byzantine Choir in 1997] gives some more hints on the performance of Barys
        Tetraphonos in the Polyeleos of Georgios Kres by the frequent use of flat and sharp
        signs and fthorai. We scanned some examples:

        (b) Descending from above, DI - GA - BOY, can have GA either sharp or natural. Often

        an example from Petros Ephesios' Anthologia where a sharp GA on descent is mandated

        <span class="name">Stephanos Lambadarios</span> and <span class="name">Konstantinos
            Protopsaltis</span> present a confusing description of Bestenigar in Konstantinos'
        "Ermineia tes Eksoterikes Mousikes". There it is mentioned that maqam Bestenigar
        uses the pitch of Cargah (GA natural) but right next to it is a scale with ZW flat
        and GA sharp (!) using the same martyria as the natural diatonic GA [<a href="../images/Bestenigar-Konstantinos-Ermineia.jpg">jpg</a>]        (scanned from Konstantinos Protopsaltis' "Ermineia tes Eksoterikes Mousikes", 1840,
        reprinted by Koultoura). This means that either Stephanos and Konstantinos mixed
        up the maqam with some other maqam which is unlikely or that they wanted to say
        that GA is sometimes (or mainly/always) sharp in Bestenigar or that GA is sharpened
        when attracted by DI as explained by Panagiotis Kiltzanidis a few years later (see
        below). In either case, their scale diagram coincides with Ecclesiastical practice
        where GA is mainly performed sharp. It disagrees with their own text a few lines
        above where they describe that GA is natural which coincides with instrumental practice.
        Or they meant something else that escapes us currently.</div>
    <div class="text">
        Following the example of his predecessors, <span class="name">Konstantinos Protopsaltis</span>
        composed a doxology in Barys Tetraphonos too [<a href="../images/BarysTetraphonos-Konstantinos-Doxologia.jpg">jpg</a>].        Notice the odd notation in places (g) and (j) where it is not clear whether the
        flat sign corresponds to BOY or to GA. Our opinion is that it corresponds to BOY
        and requires GA sharp as does Barys Tetraphonos when cadencing to GA. Konstantinos
        (or rather Stephanos Lambadarios who actually transcribed the doxology in the New
        Notation) also notates the occasional GA sharp with chromatic fthorai [<a href="../images/BarysTetraphonos-Konstantinos-Doxologia-DiFlatIson.jpg">jpg</a>]        (notice the unusual flat on an ison) and here [<a href="../images/BarysTetraphonos-Konstantinos-Doxologia-SoftChromaticDescent.jpg">jpg</a>].        In other cases like (c) here, GA is probably meant to be performed natural [<a href="../images/BarysTetraphonos-Konstantinos-Doxologia-GaNaturalMaybe.jpg">jpg</a>].    </div>
    <div class="text">
        In that same year (1840), <span class="name">Georgios Lesvios</span> (a student
        of the Three Teachers in early 19th century) proposes a new name "Tenth Mode" to
        replace the "barbaric" [sic] in his opinion Arabo-Persian name "Bestenigar" which
        he identifies with "Barys Tetraphonos" and mentions that in this mode are chanted
        "the doxology of Iakovos Protopsaltis, the katavasiai of Pentecost and the "Ainei
        e Psyche Mou" of Chourmouzios Chartophylax and plenty of external music songs" [<a
            href="http://anemi.lib.uoc.gr/metadata/1/1/0/metadata-06-0000110.tkl">html</a>,
        page 11] (from anemi.lib.uoc). Here is the presentation of this "Tenth mode" by
        Georgios Lesvios from his theory book. [<a href="../images/Bestenigar-Lesvios.jpg">jpg</a>]        (scanned from Georgios Lesvios' "Eisagoge Eis to Theoretikon te kai Praktikon Tis
        Mousikis Technis", Athens, 1840, reprinted by Regopoulos, 1994, click for original
        size). So, according to Georgios Lesvios, both the Ecclesiastical pieces of Barys
        Tetraphonos (like Iakovos' doxology) and the external music songs are chanted in
        one and the same mode. That simplifies the presentation however does not resolve
        the issue of the pitch of GA. If we were to accept Lesvios' description, GA is always
        natural and DI is always flat in this mode which clearly is not true in Ecclesiastical
        oral practice (only in external/folk modern instrumental practice).
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Forty years later, <span class="name">Panagiotis Kiltzanidis</span> presents Bestenigar
        with GA natural (and only sharp when attracted by DI but no other time) and DI and
        ZW flat and occasionaly BOY flat.[<a href="../images/Bestenigar-Kiltzanidis.jpg">jpg</a>]        (scanned by Vasili Zacharis from Panagiotis Kiltzanidis' "Methodike Didaskalia of
        Greek Music", Constantinople, 1881, reprinted by Regopoulos). Surprisingly, Kiltzanidis
        writes a flat sign next to the martyria of DI on the scale diagram, however he does
        not provide a special interval line for that flat in the diagram (as he does with
        the other flat/sharp signs on other notes). Note also that the normal diatonic martyria
        of DI is used for the permanently, according to the scale, flat DI. Of interest
        is that Kiltzanidis, a member of the <span class="name">Patriarchal Committee of 1881-83</span>,
        knows and publishes about Bestenigar before the Committee convenes however no explicit
        mention of it or Barys Tetraphonos was made in the presentation of the Ecclesiastical
        Modes by the Committee.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        In early 20th century, the first Ecclesiastical music theory book to talk about
        GA sharp in Barys Diatonic Mode was that of <span class="name">Konstantinos Psahos</span>
        [<a href="../images/BarysTetraphonos-Psahos.jpg">jpg</a>] (scanned from Konstantinos Psahos'        "To Oktaechon Systema...", published by Georgios Hatzitheodorou). Psahos didn't
        see GA sharp as a permanent sharpening, just as a melodic attraction towards making
        the fifth interval perfect when the melody revolves around GA because in his opinion
        the imperfect fifth interval is "not acceptable by nature" (analogion.com: Wonder
        whether he thought that maqam Bestenigar of external intrumental music was also
        unacceptable by nature!). Surprisingly he doesn't talk about flattening DI and ZW
        which is so common in compositions of Barys Tetraphonos. And he does not cover cases
        where GA is sharpened when the melody does not revolve around it (as we demonstrate
        on this page). Despite that, it seems that this is the first attempt at an explanation
        of when GA is sharp and when it isn't in Barys Diatonic.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        A contemporary of Psahos, <span class="name">Monk Nektarios</span> presents a Cherouvikon
        of Misael Misaelidis Protopsaltis of Smyrna in a modal branch of Barys which according
        to the comment at the top of the piece has "GA always sharp". It is not clear whether
        the comment was added by Misaelidis or by Monk Nektarios. Regardless, the author
        of the comment either ignored the name "Tetraphonos" or intentionally omitted it
        to avoid the exact confusion discussed on this page. However, this seems to be the
        first Ecclesiastical score that explicitly mentions Barys with a permanent sharp
        GA.

        Around the same time (early 20th century), <span class="name">Ioannis Palasis</span>
        wrote a Trisagion in Barys Tetraphonos (not labelled as such though) that is chanted
        with GA always sharp by the choir of the Constantinopolitan Friends of Music. See
        the score [<a href="../images/BarysTetraphonos-Palasis.jpg">jpg</a>] (scanned from Lykourgos        Petridis' "Leitourgia") and listen to the recording [<a href="http://www.ieropsaltis.com/music/11_TrisagDyn_Pal_CMK.rm">rm</a>,
        1.7 Mb] (from ieropsaltis.com). A number of other modern (20th cent.) compositions
        of Trisagia and Dynamis exist that are all chanted in exactly the same way, even
        though GA is not explicitly notated sharp.</div>
    <div class="text">
        A few years after Psahos, in the 1940s, Archon First Domestichos <span class="name">
            Angelos Boudouris</span> becomes the first ever Patriarchal theoretician to
        acknowledge the existence of Barys Diatonic Tetraphonos as an independent modal
        branch and presents it as an independent branch of Barys Diatonic. He says that
        Barys Tetraphonos (the mode of Iakovos' doxology) has DI flat and does not mention
        at all about GA (therefore assuming it natural). Boudouris reiterates the incorrect
        theoretical descriptions of the past regarding GA, disagreeing with oral tradition.
        He seems to ignore (or chose to ignore) Psahos' explanation about a sharp GA in
        Barys Diatonic. He could obviously hear the sharpened GA in performance however
        he did not go on to describe "new theory" for it.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        A few years later, in the 1950s, <span class="name">Avraam Efthemiadis</span> does
        not talk at all about a sharpened GA when discussing Barys Diatonic Tetraphonos,
        he only mentions the flattening of DI and ZW when the melody revolves around GA
        which he observes that is the same in all diatonic modes [<a href="../images/BarysTetraphonos-Efthemiadis.jpg">jpg</a>]        (scanned from "Mathemata Byzantines Ecclesiastikes Mousikes", p. 437). He says that
        this is the mode in which Iakovos' doxology is chanted in. From the description
        one understands that Iakovos Doxology is chanted with GA natural which disagrees
        with oral tradition. Efthemiadis seems to also have ignored (or chose to ignore)
        Psahos' explanation about GA sharp in Barys Diatonic and tried to justify the reiterated
        confusing theory of GA being the "same as in all diatonic modes" by giving a generic
        explanation which however appears incorrect.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        In 1982, <span class="name">Simon Karas</span> in his "Methodos Tes Ellenikes Mousikes
        - Theoretikon", vol I, p. 335, [<a href="../images/Karas-Bestenigar.jpg">jpg</a>] attempted        to resolve the confusion by becoming the first to theoretically present Bestenigar
        as a special case of what he called plain ("haplos") Barys Diatonic mode with GA
        always natural. This was a different mode from Barys Tetraphonos which according
        to Karas has a sharp GA which only natural when the melody reaches it from below
        and then descends. The intervals of Barys Tetraphonos "Bestenigar" as presented
        by Karas match exactly those of the maqam Bestenigar i.e. there is an imperfect
        fifth interval ZW- GA natural (38 instead of 42 moria). Karas acknowledges that
        this mode has also been called "Barys Tetraphonos" by the modern ecclesiastical
        musicians. He also observes that ecclesiastical musicians before him had not presented
        a special martyria (modal sign) for this mode, choosing to just indicate it with
        flat signs on DI and ZA througout the piece instead. Karas even composed and presented
        a suitable apechema for it as there didn't exist one (he did the same for Barys
        Tetraphonos with GA sharp for the same reason). Specifically, according to Karas,
        the Greek name of the mode should be Mesos of Plagal First Diphonos Mode, consisting
        of a diphonia [ZW-PA] followed by diphonia [PA-GA natural] followed by a soft chromatic
        tetrachord [GA natural-DI flat-KE natural-high ZW flat].". He mentions that this
        is the mode in which Iakovos' doxology is chanted. What is strange here is that
        Karas doesn't seem to have noticed or chose to ignore the discrepancy between oral
        tradition and his theoretical presentation. He didn't consider the possibility of
        the mode using a different scale in folk (Bestenigar) and ecclesiastical music (Tetraphonos).
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        In late 20th century, Karas' student, musicologist <span class="name">Marios Mavroeidis</span>,
        disagrees with Karas in his book "Echos, Tropos, Maqam" [reference pending] and
        says that maqam Bestenigar does not have an equivalent in Ecclesiastical music.
        Mavroeidis obviously had in mind the instrumental version of the maqam. Despite
        that comment, Mavroeidis does not endeavour to resolve the confusion discussed in
        this page.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        In 1991, protopsaltis <span class="name">Charalambos Karakatsanis</span> presents
        yet another theory, more to the point, although not without confusing or missing
        elements. In his book "Mousikon Leimonarion" (vol. 7 on Barys Mode) he attempts
        to clarify some things based on his experience and his reading of earlier works
        by <span class="name">Simon Karas</span>, <span class="name">Spyros Kapsaskis</span>
        and <span class="name">Theodoros Hatzitheodorou</span>. Karakatsanis says that Barys
        Diatonic uses a single scale with GA sharp. He doesn't accept GA natural in Barys
        Diatonic, with Spyros Kapsaskis' justification that the mode should have a major
        tone (12 moria) as a disjuntive (diazeuktikos) tone between its two tetrachords.
        And he correctly points out the raison d'etre of the chromatic fthorai in pieces
        of Barys Diatonic mode to signify a sharp GA (and a flat BOY). Inside his book (page
        232) he presents an apechema of Barys with GA sharp [scan pending]. He also proposes
        using a different martyria for GA of Barys Diatonic, to signify that it is sharp,
        following the example of Simon Karas. His theory is unclear in a few places at least:
        <br />
        (a) He says that GA is to be performed natural as in First Mode when a diatonic
        fthora "resolves" a chromatic one. This may be true sometimes (like in "Ton Despotin")
        in modern oral tradition but certainly it is not a general rule. E.g. the Polyeleos
        "Logon Agathon" of Georgios Kres and other pieces do not follow this rule. Even
        the second part of "Ton Despotin" can be chanted in Barys Tetraphonos as demonstrated
        by Georgios Michalakis [<a href="http://graeca.mrezha.net/upload/MontrealPsaltiki/GKM_MICHALAKIS_Georgios/GKM_Hellenic_TonDespotinChroumouziosNoFthora._HomeSoloRVRB.mp3">mp3</a>].
        He doesn't mention anything about GA returning to its natural position when the
        melody reaches it from below and then descends.
        <br />
        (b) He quotes Theodoros Hatzitheodorou (page 5 of the introduction) saying that
        in "Barys Tetraphonos" (as he calls it) GA is steady ("statheros", meaning natural)
        as opposed to Barys Heptaphonos where GA is always sharp. However, this is not true
        in today's practice as we have seen.
        <br />
        (c) In page 8 of the introduction, he provides a scale for maqam Bestenigar with
        BOY flat, GA sharp, DI flat, KE flat (!), and ZW enharmonic (atzem) with the following
        explanation "starts from GA, ends in low ZW, ascending it requires ZW flat and descending
        it requires GA sharp". He doesn't mention where he got this scale from and it is
        surprising that he doesn't refer to the difference between the external and ecclesiastical
        music traditions on the matter. Finally, KE flat in this mode seems incorrect. The
        indication that Bestenigar pieces start from GA is interesting and it is generally
        true that so-called "Bestenigar" pieces do start from GA. So perhaps "Bestenigar"        after all could be Barys Tetraphonos which starts from GA and descends.
        <br />
        (d) He doesn't provide references for most of his theoretical points about Barys.
        <br />
        In the music scores of the book, in the Leitourgika of Dimitrios Mavropoulos (page
        285), we spotted a NH flat on descent in Barys Diatonic mode which was rather surprising.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        In 2005, musicologist <span class="name">Vasilios Katsifis</span> in his book criticising
        Karas' theory [reference pending] does not mention anything particularly relevant
        about Karas' presentation of Bestenigar, however elsewhere he says that in his opinion
        Barys Tetraphonos always has DI flat and ZW flat (unlike Karas who supports only
        Bestenigar has those flats). He does not present a numbered scale of Barys Tetraphonos.
        He disagrees with Karas about the existence of Barys Bestenigar and also about Plain
        "Haplos" Barys and presents Barys Tetraphonos with GA natural and DI/ZW flat without
        mentioning anything about GA sharp in it [<a href="../images/BarysTetraphonos-Katsifis.jpg">jpg</a>,        256 Kb]. We do not know why Katsifis also chooses to ignore oral tradition and previous
        theoretical works in this matter and keeps reiterating incorrect theories.

    <div class="text">
        In 2006, <span class="name">Georgios Michalakis</span> [<a href="GKM.html">html</a>],        acknowledges that new theory needs to be written for Barys Diatonic (especially
        for the type of Barys with "special intervals" as he calls the Barys Tetraphonos
        we study on this page) and presents his ideas on the matter (see our page on Barys
        Diatonic [<a href="Barys.html">html</a>]). Disagreeing with all other theoreticians        he sees what we have been calling GA sharp of Barys Tetraphonos as GA natural and,
        to justify the Tetraphonos intervals below it, he proposes a theory where all intervals
        below (the natural) GA are lowered. A tentative interval diagram without numbers
        for all intervals of interest is presented. His theory does not seem to have basis
        in psaltic practice. Psaltai generally think of a sharp GA when chanting this mode
        and not of shortened intervals below it.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="heading">
        Conclusions</div>
    <div class="text">
        Very little has been written by Byzantine Music theoreticians about Barys Diatonic
        and Barys Tetraphonos in particular. The descriptions are incomplete, contradicting
        each other and confusing. This probably is a result of losing the sense of modal
        branches (Diphonos, Triphonos, Tetraphonos, Heptaphonos) after the reform of the
        Three Teachers in 1814. The most likely reason in our opinion is that Barys Tetraphonos
        was assumed "known" for someone who knew how to chant Barys Diatonic therefore not
        requiring special mention. The relative silence of past theoreticians on the subject
        could also indicate that the mode was perhaps recently (18th century) "imported"        from external music and therefore noone really knew much about it. Finally, it could
        be that the mode changed in the course of time to use special intervals that needed
        new theory to be written.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        According to the literature, there is strong evidence that Barys Tetraphonos was
        seen as identical to maqam Bestenigar of external music in the 19th century (see
        literature survey above). If that's indeed true, it means that either Ecclesiastical
        oral tradition changed since then or that the performance of the maqam in external
        music changed. A hypothetical explanation is that oral tradition changed the intervals
        of Barys Tetraphonos due to the difficulty or detest of performing the imperfect
        fifth of Bestenigar or for other reasons. Another equally likely hypothesis is that
        the maqam changed in the 19th or 20th century to use a Sabah scale on top of Iraq.
        Finally, it is not unlikely that the identity of Barys Tetraphonos and maqam Bestenigar
        may have always been a misconception of psaltai and theoreticians which led to the
        misrepresentation of the maqam (and the mode) in the musical scores and theory books
        until today.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Identifying Barys Tetraphonos with maqam "Bestenigar" as it is today performed in
        instrumental music is wrong. Psaltic oral tradition and external instrumental music
        use different intervals to perform (secular in this case) pieces that are written
        in this mode. Based on the literature, the mode and the maqam could have been identical
        in the 19th century however today they are performed differently. Because of this
        uncertainty, we cannot be sure how they songs of Euterpe and Pandora were chanted
        in the 19th century.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        There is only one independent Barys Tetraphonos Mode Ecclesiastical music, which
        in terms of intervals it is performed the same way regardless of the presence of
        flat signs on DI and ZW and regardless whether the name "Bestenigar" is associated
        with a piece (like Iakovos' doxology). The name "Bestenigar" could just mean melodies
        of Barys Tetraphonos that start from GA (sharp) showing the DI flat and ZW flat
        pitches and descending to low ZW (as mentioned by Charalambos Karakatsanis). Simon
        Karas's presentation of "Bestenigar" as an Ecclesiastical mode (mesos of Plagal
        First Diphonos Mode) has no basis in modern Ecclesiastical practice. There is also
        Barys Tetraphonos of Koukouzelis' Mega Ison which is essentially Plagal Fourth Mode
        from GA and only appears in passages of papadic pieces.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        If some compositions today require to be chanted in maqam Bestenigar (with GA always
        natural) then only such pieces should be labelled "Bestenigar" with a note requiring
        GA natural. All others should be labelled "Barys Tetraphonos" and notated consistently
        (for instance using the useful modal martyries of Barys Tetraphonos presented by
        Simon Karas in his Theoretikon).
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        The papadic pieces of Barys Diatonic are generally chanted in Barys Tetraphonos
        with passages of First (or Plagal First) Mode Diphonos, and Barys Heptaphonos [Recordings
        pending].
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Given the above analysis, it would be useful to write a complete theory of Barys
        Tetraphonos (and Barys Diatonic). We will be grateful if anyone provides more information
        on these subjects.

        Τα μαθήματα του Βαρέως Διατονικού ήχου όπως η περίφημη δοξολογία του Ιακώβου Πρωτοψάλτου
        που λέγονται από πολλούς οτι ψάλλονται με την κλίμακα του μακάμ Πεστενιγκιάρ με
        ΓΑ φυσικό, ΔΙ ύφεση και ΖΩ ύφεση, δέν ψάλλονται έτσι στην πράξη (δείτε τη μελέτη
        στα Αγγλικά πιό κάτω για παραδείγματα αυτού του μακάμ στην Ανατολική μουσική). Σύμφωνα
        με την προφορική παράδοση (χωρίς εξαιρέσεις) ψάλλονται με την κλίμακα του Βαρέως
        Τετραφώνου με ΓΑ υψωμένο κατά το πλείστον, ΔΙ ελάχιστα ύφεση και ΖΩ ύφεση (δείτε
        τη μελέτη στα Αγγλικά πιό κάτω για ηχογραφήσεις και κείμενα γνωστών εκκλησιαστικών
        συνθέσεων που φέρονται να ανήκουν σε αυτό τον ήχο). Ο Γεώργιος Λέσβιος, ο Χαρίλαος
        Ταλιαδώρος, ο Σίμων Καράς (Θεωρητικόν, τόμος 1, σ. 335) και άλλοι μάλλον λανθασμένα
        λένε οτι ψάλλονται με την κλίμακα του Πεστενιγκιάρ. Και μάλλον σωστά άλλοι (π.χ.
        ο Άγγελος Βουδούρης, Εισαγωγή εις την Βυζαντινήν Μουσικήν, σ. 379, Μάριος Μαυροειδής,
        "Ήχος, Τρόπος, Μακάμ" [αναφορά αναμένεται]) παρουσιάζουν τον ήχο αυτό σαν Βαρύ Τετράφωνο
        συμφωνώντας με την προφορική παράδοση. Είναι όμως πιθανόν συνθέσεις της εξωτερικής
        μουσικής, που καταγράφονται και αυτές με ακριβώς τον ίδιο τρόπο σαν Βαρύς Τετράφωνος
        με ΔΙ και ΖΩ ύφεση, όντως να τραγουδιούνται με την κλίματα του ανατολικού αυτού
        δρόμου (μάλιστα όταν επιγράφονται με το όνομα του μακάμ αυτού όπως συνήθως). Το
        ίδιο πιθανώς να ισχύει και για κάποιες εκκλησιαστικές συνθέσεις. Δυστυχώς δεν υπάρχουν
        πολλές παλιές (ή σύγχρονες) ηχογραφήσεις για να διαλευκάνουν αυτό το θέμα. Μπορεί
        η προφορική παράδοση να μήν αποδίδει σωστά αυτό τον ήχο; Μάλλλον όχι. Υπάρχουν δύο
        είδη Βαρέως Τετραφώνου ένα με ΔΙ και ΖΩ ύφεση και ένα χωρίς;. Μάλλον όχι. Είναι
        αυτός ο ήχος της Δοξολογίας του Ιακώβου δάνειο από την εξωτερική μουσική; Πιθανώς,
        η αρχαιότερη μαρτυρία που έχουμε είναι του Αποστόλου Κώνστα (τέλος 18ου αι.). Έκαναν
        λάθος οι παλαιοί και νέοι ψάλτες (και ο Καράς) που λέγανε αυτές τις συνθέσεις Πεστενιγκιάρ;        Όπως φαίνεται, ναί.

        Archon Domestikos Angelos Boudouris labels Iakovos' doxology as "Barys Tetraphonos"        [<a href="../pdf/dox-bestenigar-iakovos.pdf">pdf</a>, 100 Kb]. Georgios Lesvios mentions        that in 1840 people knew this mode as "Bestenigar" (see reference below on this
        page). Harilaos Taliadoros (in an unpublished manuscript set of slow doxologies)
        labels the same doxology as "Bestenigar". Psaltai in general, talk about Iakovos
        Doxology as "Bestenigar". Reading the literature one is lead to believe that Barys
        Tetraphonos and maqam Bestenigar are one and the same thing. Well, modern oral tradition
        and instrumental practice disagree.
        <p />
        In oral practice, the doxology of Iakovos for instance, is not chanted with the
        intervals of maqam Bestenigar (as heard in external music) but with different intervals.
        Specifically with a raised GA most of the time (so that the pentachord ZW-GA is
        a perfect fifth) and a slightly flattened DI (probably even less flat than in maqam
        Sabah in external music).
        -->
    <!--    <div class="text">
        One could argue that the second part of the ancient Pheme "Ton Despotin kai Archierean"        could be chanted in Tetraphonos and not in (Plagal) First Diphonos with ison ZW
        (see example recording by Georgios Michalakis 
        and the accompanying discussion in our page on Barys mode [<a href="Barys.html">html</a>]).        However, oral tradition pretty much always peforms such phrases as (Plagal) First
        Mode Diphonos with ison on PA and not as Barys Tetraphonos.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Another piece of evidence that this mode was not originally used in Ecclesiastical
        music is that very few pieces comparatively are written and chanted in this mode
        compared to quite a few in external music (as mentioned by Georgios Lesvios too).
        More often, Tetraphonos appears as individual phrases of papadic pieces of Barys
        Diatonic mode where DI and ZW is explicitly or implicitly flattened and the melody
        revolves around GA.
