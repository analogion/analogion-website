    <div class="page-title">Musical Committee of 1881</div>
    <div class="page-subtitle">Analysis of its various conclusions and recommendations</div>

<div class="heading">Issue</div>
<div class="text">
In 1881 the Ecumenical Patriarchate established a special committee to deal with
various theoretical and practical issues connected with the Byzantine chant. The reason to create
such a committee was an opinion that the work of Three Teachers, though 
venerable and important, had some mistakes and omissions. The secondary
reason seems to be the spirit of the century, i.e. tendency to greater systematisation 
and a more scientific approach, an influence coming from the West. The committee members
included Georgios Biolakis (Archon Protopsaltis of the Great Church), 
Eustratios Papadopoulos, Monk Ioasaph, Panagiotis Kiltzanidis, Andreas Spatharis and Georgios 
Progakis. Archimandrite Germanos Afthonidis was appointed its head. Strangely enough,
the committee did not include as its members two main representatives of
the Patriarchal school of chanting of that time, former Archon Protopsaltis Georgios
Raidestinos, and Archon Lampadarios Nikolaos Stogiannou. The committee
work resulted in a little booklet (ca. 60 pages in total) "Stoicheiodes Didaskalia Tes Ekklesiastikes
Mousikes", which was published in 1888 with the Patriarchal approval. Since then this work
is thought to be the reference point for the Byzantine music theory and practice.
However, it seems the acceptance was not universal. The committee work was not 
valued highly by Patriarchal chanters, as it can be seen from various writings of Archon Domestikos
Angelos Boudouris [ref pending]. Its work was not accepted in totality by some musicologists as well,
e.g. Simon Karas. The Epitrope work attracted particular attention during the past two decades,
due to the so-called musicological issue. Both sides involved in the dispute
used various Epitrope conclusions against each other, and it now appears that neither accepts all
Epitrope conclusions, even though some dispute participants do not want to admit it explicitely.
In this page we present various conclusions and recommendations of the Epitrope, together with
their analysis and critical evaluation.
</div>

<div class="heading">Main contributions and recommendations of the committee</div>
<div class="text">
The following are the main contributions and recommendations of the committee:

<div class="item">1) Attempt to precisely define interval sizes of the three genoi of the Byzantine chant:
diatonic, chromatic and enharmonic. This part of the Epitrope work is rather widespread, however it
has not been accepted in its entirety by Simon Karas (and subsequently by his students),
who with the help of a mathematician Stavros Brachamis tried to achieve even greater precision
[ref pending]. Fr. Charalampos Oikonomou in his theoretikon proposed his own corrections and
modifications [ref pending]. Other respected theoreticians, e.g. Michael Chatziathanasiou and Abraam Euthymiadis also
worked on this subject.</div>

<div class="item">2) Recommendation to fix diatonic Ni at a fixed frequency roughly corresponding
to the Do of European music and to measure all other intervals with respect to this fixed Ni.
This advice has not been implemented in practice, since selecting base pitches by psaltai depends
on many factors, including their voice qualities, general vocal condition and many others.</div>

<div class="item">3) Recommendation to systematically write down elxeis in music scores and redefinition of
flat/sharp signs. This advice was not followed even by the committee members themselves. For a detailed
discussion of this issue, see a special page dedicated to it [<a href="MelodicAttractions.html">html</a>].</div>

<div class="item">4) Attempt to describe the function of quality characters, 
with as great precision as possible (according to what the committee says). Their conclusions and definitions would barely
fill two pages of a booklet, and were deemed inadequate and incomplete by some musicologists, most notably Simon Karas.
</div>

</div>

<div class="heading">Individual points</div>
<div class="text">
The committee makes several statements, which are either contradictory or wrong, or have lead to confusion 
in the psaltic world.

<div class="item">1) Without providing any evidence or motivation whatsoever, the committee divides the ecclesiastic hymns
in two categoris: rhythmic (poetical hymns) and arrhythmic (prose hymns). To the first category belong
Heirmoi, Katabasiai, Kanons, Makarismoi, Prosomoia, Kontakia, Exapostelaria and all short melodies.
To the second category belong Psalter, Stichera and Aposticha of the Oktoechos, Idiomela and Automela, Doxastika, Doxologies,
Cheroubika, Koinonika, and slow melodies similar to them. Moreover, the committee believes that
musically there exist only two categories of hymns: Heirmologic (to which belong pieces in Short Heiromologic and Slow
Heirmologic genres, as well as Kalophonikoi Heirmoi) and Sticheraric (to which belong pieces in Short Sticheraric,
Slow Sticheraric and Papadic genres). Such a classification is not only untraditional, but also highly confusing,
as it does not allow to thoroughly discuss and present individual characteristics of e.g. Sticheraric and Papadic pieces.
The committee itself is inconsistent in its classification, as later on it occasionally mentions both Papadic and Sticheraric pieces.
</div>

<div class="item">2) According to the definition of elxis (melodic attraction) that the committee provides,
it can happen only in upward direction. This of course is untrue, if one takes into account the oral tradition.
Apparently unaware of the contradiction, in the next few pages following the definition,
the committee presents several examples of downward elxeis.
</div>

<div class="item">3) The committee makes a paradoxical statement that elxeis are rarely executed in the Sticheraric genre
(which for them means Sticheraric and Papadic pieces), a claim that finds no support in the oral tradition, and which
is rejected even by those, who tend to accept the committee work on elxeis. In contradiction with their claim, in the subsequent pages the Epitrope
mentions several elxeis in various Modes which are done in Sticheraric and Papadic pieces.
</div>

<div class="item">4) The committee says that in the First Mode GA is attracted by DI and is sharpened by four tmemata (eight moria).
Elsewhere it says that GA of the Fourth Mode follows the same rules as GA of the First Mode. Such a sharp GA finds no support
in the received oral tradition, see a special page dedicated to the issue [<a href="GaFirstMode.html">html</a>].</div>

<div class="item">5) The committee says that in the First Mode Diphonos DI is attracted by GA and is flattened by two tmemata (four moria).
This statement has led to exaggerations by some psaltai, who execute a considerably flatter DI, then the majority of other chanters (including those
of the Patriarchate) do. See a special page dedicated to the issue [<a href="DiFlatFirstMode.html">html</a>].</div>

<div class="item">6) The committee says that in the Second Mode GA is raised on ascent by two tmemata (four moria). This statement
was slightly modified by Psachos and Karas, who tried to describe this elxis in greater detail (e.g. Psachos maintened that GA is
sharpened by two moria, and in case when melody is evolving around DI, then by four moria). In practice the Epitrope conclusion
resulted in exaggeration by Karas' followers, who overdo this elxis. See a special page dedicated to the issue [<a href="GaSecondMode.html">html</a>].</div>
