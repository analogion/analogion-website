         <span class="name">Filotheu Monahul</span>: According to his direct disciples, Nektarios was born in the city of Husi, Moldavia
        / Moldovlahia / Bogdania around 1804. His parents send him to learn music to a Greek
        bishop named Gregorios, retreated in Moldova, after he completed his regular school
        with the same teacher. He entered Neamt Monastery and became student of Dorothei
        the Hieromonk, Protopsaltis of that time in Neamt. Dorothei was the student of Visarion,
        who was still alive when Nectarie was tonsured as a monk. The oldest manuscript
        of Nectarie was written in Jerusalem, in 1836. One biography claims that when he
        returned from Jerusalem was tonsured in Neamt. We don't know that; what we know
        is he returned to Neamt, then moved to Valachian monasteries of Ciolanu and Caldarusani,
        and finally reached Athos in 1842 and became a hermit, with his brother, near St.
        Anna, carving crosses. There he started to chant, being invited to many feasts at
        the great monasteries. In 1852 he moved to the Rumanian skete of Prodromu. He passed
        away to our Lord at the age of 95, in 1899, the night of 17th to 18th of December.
        <p />
        He promoted an ecumenical view of the Byzantine inheritance, composing different
        chants mainly in Rumanian, but also Greek and Slavonic. Some of them were published
        starting with 1897 by his disciple, hieromonk Dometie Ionescu (this was one of the
        most loved Byzantine music book in Latin characters ever). In Iasi Archim. Clement
        Haralam published in 2003 one of his masterpieces, the Sticherarion for the feasts
        of the year. 3 years ago prof. Vasile Vasile published his chants for the Divine
        Liturgy, with many Axions in the three languages mentioned before; unfortunately
        the text of his longer chants was modified in many places in this edition.

    <div class="text">
        <span class="name">Prof. Trian Ocneanu</span>: He was a protopsaltis not only of
        the Rumanian skete Prodromul, but also a 'protopsaltis of the Holy Mount', who used
        to be called by some of his Greek brothers 'The New Koukouzeles'. Since the Prodromul
        Skete is on the territory of the Great Lavra, he used to be invited to sing in the
        Lavra on the great feasts. In AMB II there is an extensive biographical note, and
        also a story in Greek about one of the events echoing his fame as a chanter among
        the Greeks.
