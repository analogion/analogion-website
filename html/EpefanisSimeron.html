        The Exaposteilarion "Epefanis simeron" as chanted be Simon Karas on www.ecclesia.gr.
        His version is singificantly different than the received oral tradition. Listen
        to it here [<a href="http://www.ecclesia.gr/Multimedia/Audio_Index/chanters/karas5.asf">asf</a>]</div>

        <span class="name">Ioannis Arvanitis</span> (answer in byzantinechant discussion
        forum): This (in Legetos) is not Karas' own version but the classic version found
        in the music books (Heirmologia by Ioannis and Petros but also in the books eg.
        of Priggos). The received tradition (where the first phrases coincide with that
        of "H Parthenos shmeron") is in fact closer to the old music of this hymn, as it
        is found in Mss of th 13th-15th cent. So, it is, in this sense, "more correct".
        But in the Heirmologion of Balasios the opposite happens: "H Parthenos shmeron"        is written in Legetos! For both, the first phrases of the old versions started from
        Pa and ended on Ni; they had the same or almost the same music. So, if we adhere
        to the books (s. above) we'll sing it in Legetos, if we follow the received tradition,
        in fact we resurrect partly the original melody!</div>
