        (translation/summary by D. Koubaroulis)<br>
        <br>
        There are three views on where the Cherubic hymn should be broken for the Great
        Entrance to take place.
        <br>
        <br>
        (a) After "ton Basilea"        <br>
        (b) After "ypodeksomenoi"<br>
        (c) After "merimnan"<br>
        <br>
        Which is the correct one?
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="text">
            Well, (a) seems to be the oldest practice which is still in use in some places today.
            It is justified - by the old musical manuscripts which start a kratema right
            after "ton Basilea" - as a musical/artistic game, an 'unexpected' break
            to the hymn to attract the attention of the people and signify the importance of
            the event. The kratema was also needed to extend the length of the first part of
            the chant to cover the time required for "Proskomide" which used to take place exactly
            at that time.<br>
            <br>
            (b) The most popular practice today. It seems to be a later intellectual "correction"            to (a) so that the hymn is broken in a grammatically/semantically correct
            place, that is a comma between subsentences of the one big sentence of the
            hymn.
            <br>
            <br>
            (c) The most rare nowadays. The fact that this is the point where the left
            chanter takes over the chant and the fact that the clergy split the hymn at
            this point when they recite it in the Altar may indicate that this was the ancient
            breaking point.
            <br>
            <br>
            From the above it is clear that no safe conclusions can be made. In the first centuries
            probably nothing was chanted during the Great Entrance (exactly as in the
            Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts today) Then Psalm 23 started to get chanted (6th
            century). When the Cherubic hymn was written and introduced, it was probably
            chanted as a refrain to the verses of Psalm 23. With the years, the verses were
            dropped and the hymn was chanted on its own one or sometimes more times. The
            evolution of chanting the hymn has been complicated and it is impossible to know
            for sure where it used to be broken in older times.<br>
