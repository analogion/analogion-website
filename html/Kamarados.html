    <pre wrap=""> From Boudouris' Mousikokritika,<br><br>$105 , p. 396<br><br>" His family came from Chios island. He was born in Constantinople in <br>1849 in Mega Revma of Bosphorus. He became a student in music of <br>Xatzi-Panagioti Kiltzanides from Proussa. In very young age he served as <br>kanonarches of Gerasimos Kannelides, chanter of the church of Christ <br>Saviour in Galata. He wasn't well educated ("anthrwpos oligwn <br>grammatwn"), very musical ("mousikwtatos"), voice rough and fake ("fwnh <br>traxeia kai no8h"). He chanted in many churches of the Archdiocese: in <br>Taxiarxis of Mega Revma, in Panagia Kaffatiani, in St John "Ton Chion", <br>and in St Constantine of Stavrodromion. As a chanter he followed his <br>teacher Kiltzanides from whom he was taught the theory of ecclesiastical <br>music as well as that of the asian music; he also knew about <br>non-ecclesiastical (folk) rhythms ("gnwstis tis ekswterikis ry8mopoieias").<br><br>$106<br><br>Despite his lack of study, Neleus formed his own notational system with <br>which he was writing his musical compositions, usually arranged from <br>lines and musical theseis of other pieces of older or newer teachers. <br>This notation system was based on the notation of the 3 teachers with <br>the addition of some other signs to denote the silence of melos ("tis <br>pausews tou melous"). It was perfectly suitable for his rough vocal <br>instrument. He was teaching his system to his students without any <br>theory book. That resulted in his system to stay with his students but <br>without any theoretical knowledge of basis<br><br>$107<br><br>He has elementary knowledge of rhythm. For the sake of rhythm he changed <br>the writing of well-established musical lines. He accepted the odd <br>rhythm ("ton peritton ry8mon") and variety in the trisemos (3/4) and <br>tetrasemos (4/4). He chanted always with the support of helpers and <br>sub-helpers ("domestikwn kai paradomestikwn"), usually his own mathemata <br>completely changed ("alloiwmena") with regard to notation, rhythmically <br>arranged to disimos (2/4) and tetrasimos (4/4). He has the custom to <br>change the tempo ("xronikh agwgh") in the middle of the piece.<br><br>$108<br><br>Although completely ignorant ("entelws adahs") of physics and <br>mathematics, for 25 years he persistently worked towards defining the <br>tonal intervals of ecclesiastical music via the chord-based fractions. <br>The result of this many-year long project was the definition of the <br>intervals of just the diatonic scales on the basis of the guide og <br>Panagiotis Kiltzanides.<br><br>$109<br><br>Because he suffered from heart dicease during the last years of his life <br>he was muscially inactive. He stayed in Mega Revma, Bosphorus where he <br>died poor and suffering poverty in 1922. His funeral was funded by the <br>local community. He left many compositions written in his own notational <br>system which were distributed to people here and there. Some of his <br>fanatical students  include Dimitrios Boutsinas, Ioannis Doukas, <br>Nikolaos Vlahopoulos (who had married Neleus' daughter), Ioannis <br>Xatzi-Konstantis from Besiktasi, Basileios Kamarados (his son), Ioannis <br>Adamantos (chanter in Vlaga, then priest and finally archimandrite), <br>Ioannis Zaharopoulos (from Anatolia), Nikolaos Angelidis (from <br>Bogadzikioy), Christos Vlahopoulos (chanter of St Charalambos of <br>Bembekion) and Ioannis Palasis.<br><br>Footnotes:<br><br>In the interpretation and understanding of the various theoretical books <br>which he tried to study this teacher, who only knew basic reading and <br>writing, was supported by his brother Thrasyvoulos Kamarados, literate <br>businessman who had come from Russia. He (his brother) would edit every <br>written document or article of study which then Neleus would publish.<br><br>Regarding his work on  tonal intervals see relevant article in  <br>"Parartema Ecclesiastikes Aletheias", issue 2, p. 11. The curious reader <br>should read that to get insight into the subject.<br><br>The theoretical knowledge that he transmitted to his students was based <br>on Kiltzanides' writing called "Guide". This writing, if published would <br>possibly provide useful musicopaleographical material to the scientist <br>musicians. However it got lost in 1915 from the desk of the teacher <br>after a visit to Neleus' home by Stavros Brahamis who had come from <br>Athens to Constantinople. Two years later than that date, it became <br>known by some publications of K. Psaxos in Athens, that the Guide was in <br>his possesion."<br><br>In his musical autobiography ("Mousikologika Apomnemoneumata") Boudouris <br>writes about Kamarados:<br><br>$41 (p. 45)<br><br>"I had heard from many people that Neleus Kamarados, right chanter of <br>the church of St Nicholas of Galata was an excellent musician and <br>knowledgable on the theoretical aspect of our ecclesiastical music. So I <br>went to the church and listened to him. After the service we met in the <br>Epitropikon room with the aim to obtain information and answers related <br>to my musical questions. I even hoped, if there was need to do so, to <br>act as a writer in order to put down on paper the theoretical knowledge <br>of Neleus. My impression from that discussion was that Neleus tried with <br>great difficulty to show that he knew something about the theory in <br>general of our music. In the end I was occupied with disappointment <br>because after all those years that Neleus professed to be a teacher of <br>ecclesiastical music, he wasn't capable to say even a couple of words <br>about  his musical work".<br><br>In his "Protopsaltika" he adds:<br><br>$143 (p.212)<br><br>"The external psaltis Neleus Kamarados when he happened to attend the <br>service at the Patriarchate and listened to Iakovos Nafpliotis chanting, <br>he always used to approach him after the end of the service to tell him <br>"I admire you for the way you chant the ecclesiastical mele" and the <br>teacher of the Great Church would reply "If you spent as many years as I <br>have spent chanting in this Church, then you would learn to chant like <br>that too".<br><br>$145<br><br>In the second Patriarchal period of Joakeim the 3rd, Georgios <br>Papadopoulos  took with him K. Psaxos and N. Kamarados and presented <br>them to the Patriarch in order to allow them to chant his Polychronismos <br>("Praise"). From that, Papadopoulos hoped to promote Kamarados for <br>Protopsaltis of the Great Church and Psaxos for Labadarios. After the <br>end of the Polychronismos, the Patriarch told them "Isn't the domestikos <br>Iakovos (Nafpliotis) a teacher of your musical college? Why didn't you <br>bring him with you?". The three good partners didn't know what to say <br>("den iksevran pws na fygwsin").<br><br><br>$283 (p 252)<br><br>With every means possible, Papadopoulos achieved the support of the <br>doctor Archigenes Pasha (of Greek roots). This doctor acted so that the <br>Patriarch would allow Kamarados' choir to chant one Sunday at the <br>Patriarchate. This was objected by the Patriarch, however he allowed <br>Kamarados to chant with his choir in the private church (Parecclesion) <br>of the Patriarch. On the arranged date, in the presence of the <br>Patriarch, many bishops, Markos Vasileiou, Christos Papaioannou and <br>other clergy and non-clergy staff, Neleus appeared with his helper <br>psaltai and canonarchs who formed his choir. They started chanting with <br>loud voices and screams ("me fwnas kai kraugas") to the degree that the <br>bishops started leaving the Parecclesion disappointed before Neleus <br>finished his work. After the end, the Patriarch ordered so that coffee <br>was offered to the psaltai. After the departure of the psaltai the <br>Patriarch said to his secretary Markos Vasileiou: "What is this mess? so <br>is that how Neleus chants with his choir? Alas, indeed, alas.. " ("Ma ti <br>xalia einai auta? Etsi loipon psallei o Nhleus me ton xoron tou? <br>Aloimonon kai trisaloimonon!")</pre>
