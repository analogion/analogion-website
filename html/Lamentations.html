        </span>1. TEXT<br>
        <br>
        The full text of all lamentations along with the verses of Amomos (as they
        <br>
        should be chanted) can be found in the Triodion book in the Orthros of Great and
        <br>
        Holy Saturday.<br>
        <br>
        There is a wonderful site with all the Greek liturgical books available online:<br>
        <br>
        <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.tcgalaska.com/glt/">http://www.tcgalaska.com/glt/</a><br>
        <br>
        So, clicking on the appropriate link:<br>
        <br>
        <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.tcgalaska.com/glt/texts/Tri/t97.htm">
            http://www.tcgalaska.com/glt/texts/Tri/t97.htm</a><br>
        <br>
        you get the text for Great and Holy Saturday. Scrolling a few pages down you
        <br>
        will find the text for the lamentations. All other publications (Papadeas, etc.)
        <br>
        contain only a subset of these and commonly without the verses.<br>
        <br>
        Notice the proper place of the lamentations in the Orthros; very early on.
        <br>
        Unfortunately, parish practice has moved them later, close to the end of the
        <br>
        service; my guess is that this was done so that even those who arrive late get
        <br>
        to hear them.<br>
        <br>
        2. MUSIC<br>
        <br>
        Here is the traditional music from the Holy Week book of Georgios Raidestinos:<br>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.isye.gatech.edu/_mlagouda/SHARE/LAMENTATIONS/lamentations1.jpg">
            http://www.isye.gatech.edu/~mlagouda/SHARE/LAMENTATIONS/lamentations1.jpg</a><br>
        <a href="http://www.isye.gatech.edu/_mlagouda/SHARE/LAMENTATIONS/lamentations2.jpg">
            http://www.isye.gatech.edu/~mlagouda/SHARE/LAMENTATIONS/lamentations2.jpg</a><br>
        <br>
        For each stanza, he provides the fast heirmologic and the slow heirmologic
        <br>
        version. You probably want to focus on the fast heirmologic which is the most
        <br>
        common in use. The slow heirmologic can be used for concluding each stanza, when
        <br>
        the first troparion is repeated at the end.<br>
        <br>
        3. ISON<br>
        <br>
        1st and 2nd stanzas: With the (proper) ending on Di, the ison can be on Pa or
        <br>
        Di, but certainly not on Ke. With the (unfortunate) ending on Ke, the ison again
        <br>
        should move to Pa (notice that Ga is natural in this ending).<br>
        <br>
        4. RECORDING<br>
        <br>
        Check out this recording from the Vatopaidi Monastery:<br>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.isye.gatech.edu/_mlagouda/SHARE/LAMENTATIONS/lamentations1.html">
            http://www.isye.gatech.edu/~mlagouda/SHARE/LAMENTATIONS/lamentations1.wma</a><br>
        <a href="http://www.isye.gatech.edu/_mlagouda/SHARE/LAMENTATIONS/lamentations2.html">
            http://www.isye.gatech.edu/~mlagouda/SHARE/LAMENTATIONS/lamentations2.wma</a><br>
        <a href="http://www.isye.gatech.edu/_mlagouda/SHARE/LAMENTATIONS/lamentations3.html">
            http://www.isye.gatech.edu/~mlagouda/SHARE/LAMENTATIONS/lamentations3.wma</a><br>
        <br>
        The files are somewhat incomplete, but you will get the idea.<br>
        <br>
        In these recordings, they sing the fast heirmologic version of the first and
        <br>
        second stanza and the slow heirmologic version of the third stanza. With some
        <br>
        minor variations, their music is the one found in the Raidestinos book posted
        <br>
        above.<br>
        <br>
        I am sure there are many recordings out there, but this is the one I have
        <br>
        available right now.<br>
        <br>
        5. TODAY's PRACTICE<br>
        <br>
        Unfortunately today's practice (very well recorded in Stan's music) has deviated
        <br>
        a lot from the above. In particular,<br>
        <br>
        1st Stanza: It became a mix of slow heirmologic (phrase "katetethis Christe")
        <br>
        and fast heirmologic (the rest of the hymn) with an incorrect ending on Ke.<br>
        <br>
        2nd Stanza: It became a mix of slow heirmologic (phrase "Axion esti") and fast
        <br>
        heirmologic (the rest of the hymn) with an incorrect ending on Ke.<br>
        <br>
        3rd Stanza: It ended up being just the second voice (parallel thirds) of a
        <br>
        harmonized variation of the traditional fast heirmologic version.<br>
        <br>
        The verses of the Amomos are not in use any more and only a selection of about
        <br>
        10 lamentations from each stanza is chanted in most US parishes. At many places,
        <br>
        the traditional practice is slowly restored. At my parish in Thessaloniki,
        <br>
        Greece we used to chant (children choir) 33 hymns from each stanza in the
        <br>
        traditional melos (see Raidestinos above) along with the verses. Also, I recall
        <br>
        that at the monastery of Panagia Pammakaristou in North Carolina we used to
        <br>
        chant all ~300 lamentations. However, I am not sure if there is any parish in
        <br>
        the US chanting more than the Papadeas selection.<br>
        <br>
        6. MY RECOMMENDATION<br>
        <br>
        Samuel, I think the best you can do for now is to use the popular today's
        <br>
        versions of the lamentations (as recorded in Stan's music with your suggestions
        <br>
        for ison Pa and no harmony in the 3rd stanza). It will be hard to do anything
        <br>
        else because it will conflict with what people are used to; at the end of the
        <br>
        day you don't want to cause problems on such a Holy Day.<br>
        <br>
        On the other hand, it's good to constantly educate ourselves, to know what
        <br>
        exists out there, how it should be and how it currently is, so that we are not
        <br>
        misled to believe that we are correct or perfect.
