perfectly I. Nafpliotis to the
degree that people were getting confused as to who was chanting. Also
reveals tha Nafpliotis was not discussing the secrets of his art

<br>
<div class="text">Boudouris (in his Musicological
Memoirs, p 261) mentions that (the
externally hired) Georgios Biolakis Protopsaltis (late 19th cent)
couldn't stand the superiority of the existing older Patriarchal
psaltai around him and tried slowly to dismiss them. He managed to
dismiss first domestikos Michael Pavlidis and the then second
domestikos Kostantinos Savopoulos and eventually (1888) the old man
lambadarios Nikolaos on the (fake) basis of being inadequate for his
role due to his age Biolakis also wanted to get rid of
Nafpliotis for a long time (because Nafpliotis was distinguished
amongst the Patriarchal teachers) but he didn't manage it.<br>
<br>
Georgios Violakis Protopsaltis did not like the superiority of the
other Patriarchal teachers that knew how to analyse the classical
texts. He didn't know how to analyse the musical theseis, his chanting
was dry and plain. So after forcing the Lambadarios and the First and
Second Domestichoi to resign, he was after getting rid of Nafpliotis as
well (who by then had become First Domestichos) as he was the only one
that knew how to chant better than the Protopsaltis. However, he didn't
manage to do it because the Patriarchal and some bishops of the Synod
liked Nafpliotis and did not like Violakis (who was rather old as
well). They used to tell Violakis "you are now old, let the Domestichos
chant more" and "you should take care of the Domestichos because he is
going to succeed you one day". The final end to Violakis' plans was
give by the Patriarch (Ioakeim the 3rd) who arranged for Nafpliotis to
marry Violakis' niece. With that, the Patriarch hit two birds with one
stone. He managed to secure Nafpliotis' place in the Patriarchate and
he prevented Nafpliotis from attempting to take over Violakis' position
any time soon.<br>
<br>
<div class="text">Boudouris mentions that in
older the commonly used composition for the communion hymn of Christmas
("Lytrwsin") was that of Petros Lambadarios, not the one by Daniel
which is the current popular choice. <br>

"I had the opinion that for someone to be restricted to the practical
learning of the (music) art, means that he doesn't master the art and
what's about the art".("Eixa tin gnwmin oti to na periorizetai kaneis
epanw eis tin kata praksin mathisin tis texnis touton simainei oti den
katexei tin texnin kai oti afora tin texnin.")<tt><br>
<br>
</tt>§65 <br>
<br>
"... in his [Chrysanthos] book and
the rest that are based on it, a most important and significant chapter
of our music is skipped, which is the issue of rhythm which pertains to
Ecclesiastical chant.There is no well written book method edited for
this exact purpose, the teaching of Eccl. music. All relevant musical
knowledge is acquired by the practising the profession of the psalti.
Whoever wants to learn the music has to go through all the melodies
that are chanted in church with his teacher as well as the various
mathemata of the services. That's why learning of the music is slow,
and those psaltai that haven't put so much effort to learn all the
series of mathemata are clearly behind the rest.According to the
teaching of our theory books, those printed in the last 100 years
onwards, musical melodies are executed by-beat "kata chronon", which
todays' psaltai consider as "rhythm". Any melos executed by the
definition that "each musical character lasts for one thesis and one
arsis and that is one chronos", - does not produce any interesting
acoustic impression. The by-beat ("kata chronon") execution of musical
melos becomes tiring ("apovainei kourastikh"). Under such
circumstances, psalmody misses out ("kathysterei") because it doesn't
please, it doesn't entertain, it doesn't appeal to the congregation.
However, I have noticed that psaltai are suffering confusion in this
matter of music. They can't distinguish "chronos" from "rhythm". They
confuse "rhythm" with "chronos" and they even identify those two
different elements of melos. Due to that confusion, they sometimes
chant by-beat and other times they chant by-rhythm. On the same topic,
I have observed the following too. There is discrepancy between theory
definitons and practice of music. From this contradiction, it is melos
that misses out with respect to its interpretation. It was observed
that when a musical piece is chanted not exactly, that is not keeping
the exact durations of the characters as defined in theory, that melos
sounds more pleasing with respect to its interpretation. And this means
that for the interpretation of each type of Eccl. melody there will be
-by necessity- special rules. But in which theoretical work should
these rules be listed? Usually, Ecclesiastical psaltai keep one arsis
and one thesis for each quantity character, extending the duration of
musical lines and modifying the melodies. Due to that, they present the
various chants, from the interpretational point of view, as if they
have no musical value and being heavy ("varea") and tiring
("kourastika"). "<br>
<br>
Dimitri: From the above it seems that Boudouris recognises that
monosemos (by-beat, tak-tak-tak) was a common practice in early 20th
century Constantinople. However, he doesn't approve of it and later (as
I have posted before) he goes on to explain that Patriarchal psaltai
chant "kata ry8mon" and that's why they please and captivate the
congregation. Having said that, he himself supported monosemos (using
the exact word) for some types of pieces e.g. fast heirmologic and fast
sticheraric (see also one of my previous posts on that). I don't know
why Boudouris believes that Chrysanthos and the other theory books
support monosemos. Didn't he read anything about OOII and tetrasemos
and the chapters on Rhythm and the division of chants with vertical
lines etc.? He seems to support parestigmenon where quantity characters
are not bound to be exactly one beat each but can deviate according to
the melodic/rhythmic pattern.<br>

<div class="text">"Georgios
Raidestinos, after his dismissal from the Patriarchal Church, chanted
in the church of St John of Chios and then went on to compose
Leitourgika in Second Mode. Until then, all psaltai of Galata were
chanting the chyma traditional Leitourgika (dk: in kliton) as
they
were done in the Patriarchal church. Raidestinos' example was followed
by the rest of the parish psaltai of Galata, who composed Leitourgika
and Axion Estin in various modes. From then onwards started the decline
of ancient ecclesiastical melos ("ektote hrxisen h kataptwsis tou
arxaiou ekklhsiastikou melous")".<br>

§115<br>

<br>

<div class="text">"This
ex-Protopsaltis corrupted the notation of the new notation system of
the trascribers for which fact he was criticised by the Patriarchal and
other music teachers of his time. The corruption and change of notation
reached the point of confusion in his own writings (" h diafthora kai
alloiwsis thw grafhs hfthase mexri tou shmeiou wste na epelth sygxisis
eis thn yp'autou xrhsimopoioumenhn grafhn"). And it was in this
corrupted notation that Raidestinos presented to the public his Holy
Week and Pentecostarion."<br>
<br>
§123<br>
<br>
"Whenever
Georgios Biolakis would "open" a musical text and start chanting a slow
Doxology which was not from the ones usually chanted in the
Patriarchal Church, Labadarios Nikolaos would shut his mouth ("ekleie
to stoma tou"), and would ask his domestikos to chant instead.
Nikolaos was a strict judge of Biolakis. He used to comment softly from
his position: "This is how they chant in Galata" (dk: suburb of
Constantinople). Everyone was scared of old-man Nikolaos, that
old
"relic" of the Patriarchal church ("to palaion touto leipsanon tou
Patriarxikou Naou")."<br>
<br>
§141<br>
<br>
"Konstantinos Psaxos and
Neleus Kamarados, both external psaltai, were of the opinion that
Byzantine Music was not chanted authentically in the Patriarchal
Church, due to the fact that the Patriarchal teachers were using
different musical texts than themselves and all the other extenal
psaltai. For the above reason, they were criticising and lobbying
against ("katetrexon kai antipoliteuonto") the Patriarchal
psaltai,
having Georgios Papadopoulos Protekdikos as their leader".<br>
<br>
§142<br>
<br>
"Konstantinos
Psaxos, since the time when he was still chanting at St George church
of the Holy Sepulchre Metochion, was claiming that he came to the
Fanarion to eradicate Iakovism ("dia na kserizwsei ton Iakovismon"),
that is the ecclesiastical psaltic domination of the first Patriarchal
domestikos Iakovos. He didn't succeed however, because he was sent to
Athens."<br>
<br>
§143 <br>
<br>
"Neleus Kamarados, whenever attending a
service at the Patriarchal church and listening to I. Naplfiotis'
chanting, would always approach him after the service and say to him "I
admire you for the way you chant the ecclesiastical pieces" and the
teacher would say to him in turn "If you spend as many years as I have
in this Church you will learn to chant like this as well".<br>
<br>
§149 <br>
<br>
"Some
of the Patriarchate clergy took the initiative to teach good-voiced
children to chant the 3rd Stasis of the Engomia (dk: Lamentations) with
diphony. They later asked for the permission of the Protopsaltis
to
allow them to chant it. The teacher replied that he would have to first
listen to the piece before giving his permission, because it is not
allowed for any arbitrary chant to be chanted in the Patriarchate. It
so happened that the Patriarch Fotios listened to a rehearsal of the
Engomia the next day and forbade the polyphonic piece on the basis that
it was not part of the established melodies of the Patriarchal Church".<br>
<br>
§165 <br>
<br>
"The
voice of Eustratios Papadopoulos (dk: also known as Kabouris) was
limited and inadequate ("periorismeni kai aneparkhs"). To balance
the
insufficiency of his voice, he would train helpers and children. He was
the one who introduced the system of helpers and domestikoi in the
parishes of Constantinople. Before his time, parish psaltai did not
have helpers, they chanted everything by themselves. Eustrarios was the
kind of person who tried to make a living out of music, which (dk:
music) he wasn't capable of serving as a psaltis".<br>
<br>
§454<br>
27 January 1939<br>
<br>
"Upon
the submission for approval by the Great Church of the intended
publication of the musical work of Oikonomos Charalambos from
Pafos,
Cyprus (dk: his theory book), a committee was formed in the
Patriarchate consisting of Metr of Elaia Agathangelos, Metr. of
Nazianzos Filotheos, the Protopsaltis Iakovos and the Labadarios
Konstantinos (dk: Klavvas). The committee was to study the work and
report its conclusion to the appropriate authorities.<br>
<br>
§455<br>
<br>
"From
a visit at home by Metr of Christoupolis Meletios, the Protopsaltis
found out that the local region councillor ("nomarxis") had found out
about this committee and was upset that he was not asked for permission
upon its formation. After the complaint of the councillor, the
committee was dissolved."<br>
<br>
§456<br>
<br>
"The
Protopsaltis informed me that a three-member committee will be coming
from Athens to find, photograph and catalogue the musical manuscripts
preserved in Constantinople, within the libraries of the EP and the
Holy Sepulchre metochion"<br>
<br>
§457<br>
<br>
"During his (dk:
Nafpliotis') illness, the very-old Protopsaltis was visited at his home
by all psaltai of the Archdiocese except Basilios Onoufriadis, who was
appointed by Protekdikos Georgios Papadopoulos (who had passed away in
Athens), as the music teacher of the Patriarchal court
("mousikodidaskalos tis patriarxikis aulis"). And that was because
Onoufriadis thinks of himself as the music teacher of music teachers
("o mousikodidaskalos twn mousikodidaskalwn") and that such a visit
“does not suit him” ("kai auto den tou tairiazei"). <br>
<br>
§458<br>
<br>
"The
Protopsaltis received letters from Chios inviting him to take a leave
and rest on the island. Forty psaltai offered to contribute financially
to raise a salary of 7.000 Greek drachmas in order to just have the
chance to hear the Protopsalti chanting every now and then. <br>
<br>
(dk: !! where is this love for traditional Byzantine Music in
our
days??)<br>
<br>
§459<br>
<br>
"Regarding
the current psaltai of Constantinople, the Protopsaltis believes that
none of them knows Byzantine Music ("kaneis twn den hkseurei thn BM").
When he’ll retire, the Patriarchal psaltai, , will make a mess ("tha ta
thalasswsousi"). Because they will not have their guide and inspirer.
Today's Ecclesiastical musicians do not study, (dk: repeats) do not
study, they are in general careless ("epipoleoi"), self-instructed
("autosxedioi"), and uneducated ("akatartistoi"). They chant with their
imagination without knowing what is the essence of what they should be
chanting. There
is some difference now between the Patriarchal and the external
teachers, as long as they follow his (dk: Nafplioti's) art. When
he’ll leave one day, he wonders what his successors will do. But God is
great. He will not let our music get lost. He will cater."<br>
<br>
§461<br>
<br>
"When,
more 100 years ago, the ecclesiastical repertoire was transcribed into
the new method, the external psaltai all followed the trascriptions and
the transcribed pieces, however, the Patriarchal psaltai continued to
chant according to the order ("taxis") established in the
Patriarchal)
Church."<br>
<br>
§462<br>
<br>
"That was the reason of the fact that until
1870 all external psaltai of the Archdiocese used to gather at the EP
every Saturday evening and under the instruction of the Protopsaltis
they exercised chanting according to the Patriarchal style ("kata to
yfos to patriarxikon"), which was not common amongst them ("oper den
hto koinon metaksy twn"). The external psaltai were aware that
their
chanting was different than the interpretation of the Patriarchal
teachers. In the EP, the musical pieces were chanted in a completely
special way ("kat'ena idiaiteron olws tropon").<br>
<br>
§463<br>
<br>
"From
the time of Patriarch Gregorios the 6th, it was attempted to capture
the melos as chanted by the Patriarchal psaltai. For that reason, a
committee was established by the most famous psaltai of that time,
which undertook the task to write down and publish the melodies
commonly chanted in the Patriarchal church. The committee went on to
publish the Mousike Bibliotheke book in two volumes in 1868 and 1869.
However, because the task was difficult, work stopped and the committee
was dissolved."<br>
<br>
§464<br>
<br>
"The one person who, through the
whole of the 19th century, fanatically kept the musical tradition of
the Patriarchal church, was Nikolaos Stogiannou, the Labadarios. He
opposed every attempt made during his time towards changing the
melodies from the state in which they were preserved by tradition. He
opposed the appointment of Georgios Biolakis (an external psaltis) who
was used to chanting according to the style of the suburb of Galata.
And such was his opposition that Biolakis was forced to chant the
musical pieces from his position of Protopsaltis by learning them
off-by-heart. This same Labadarios, also opposed Biolakis' manic desire
("manian") to introduce into the Patriarchal church unusual pieces of
his (dk: Biolakis') successor (dk: and student) Aristeidis. who
wanted
to present himself as chanting according to the ancient style
("arxaioprepws") because he had served as a canonarchos of Protopsaltis
Ioannis Byzantios."<br>
<br>
§465<br>
<br>
"After
Nikolaos' (dk: forced?) retirement ("meta tin apomakrynsin tou
Nikolaou"), when Aristidis became Labadarios on the Presanctified
Liturgy on a day of the 1st week of Lent coinciding with a saint's
feast, he chanted the Koinwnikon "Eis Mnemosynon" on the basis of the
melody of "Geusasthe" of Kladas. Nikolaos Labadarios was sitting on a
stasidion close to the entrance of the church -where the pangarion was
located then- and was observing the choirs as he did until his
death.
After the dismissal of the service, he called the first Domestikos
Iakovos (dk: Nafpliotis) and asked him "Mousikologiotate (dk
most-musical = musicologisimus), what did you think about the
Koinonikon as was chanted by Mr. Aristidis?" (he wouldn't call him
Labadarios). Following the domestikos' silence, the teacher added:
“what Mr Aristidis does, has no place here. This is how the psaltai of
Galata chant. In this place, only the pieces of the Patriarchal
teachers are to be chanted. This is what prevails ("auto isxyei") and
this is what should always prevail in the future."<br>
<br>
§466<br>
<br>
"Due
to Nikolaos' opposition, both Biolakis and Aristidis were discouraged
to the point that they didn't introduce any external pieces while
Nikolaos was alive. Nikolaos' example was followed by domestikoi
Iakovos (dk: Nafpliotis) and Konstantinos (dk: Klavvas), both of them
sharing the conservatism of the late Nikolaos. And after all that, when
they became Protopsaltis and Labadarios respectively, they followed the
tradition of the Patriarchate".<br>
<br>
§467<br>
<br>
"In
the EP they never chanted Bereketis' Theotoke Parthene during the
artoklasia. They always chanted a single idiomelon from those of the
Liti. The external (non-EP) psaltai used to chant the mathema of
Bereketis. In addition, in the EP, when it was required, they used to
always chant "Makarios Aner" of Petros Labadarios, abridged by Manouel
Protopsaltis and never the Anoixantaria of Th. Fokaeus".<br>
<br>
§468<br>
<br>
4 Feb 1939<br>
<br>
"From
my Protopsaltis (dk: Nafpliotis), I found out that he was visited today
by Simon Karas of Athens, member of the three-member committee visiting
the EP, an archaeologist specialising in musical manuscripts of
Byzantine Music. The visitor also gave him (dk: Nafplioti) a reference
letter from Manouel Gedeon, then living in Athens, encouraging the
Protopsaltis to help Mr. Karas in his work."<br>
<br>
§469<br>
<br>
"According
to the teacher (dk: Nafpliotis), Karas is intending to collect whatever
manuscripts he could find in Constantinople so as to photograph their
content. Karas asked him to give him the manuscripts in his library for
the above purpose. For that, the teacher asked for the two manuscripts
he had lent me, namely the Anastasimatarion and the Doxastarion of the
time of Manouel Protopsaltis"<br>
<br>
§470<br>
<br>
"From what Karas told
the Protopsaltis, the committee was sent to Constantinople to collect
whatever treasures ("keimhlia") are preserved here such as icons,
manuscripts, musical manuscripts, paintings, folk songs, etc. The other
two members of the committee were the son of Nikolaos Politis,
ambassador of Greece in Paris, and the son of law professor, Kalligas."<br>
<br>
§471<br>
<br>
"From
what Karas told the Protopsaltis, Konstantinos Psaxos failed
("exreokopise") and the music community in Athens stopped taking him
seriously ("epause na ton logariazei"). Because Psaxos was recently of
the opinion that it is possible and is appropriate ("oti dynatai kai
prepei") to introduce the Armonion (dk: organ, but doesn't clarify what
type of organ) in the churches of Greece."<br>
<br>
§472<br>
<br>
8 Feb 1939<br>
<br>
"The
musical manuscripts of the library of the Protopsaltis, already
catalogued by Simon Karas, are shortly to be sent to Athens to be
handed over to the National Library of Greece"<br>
<br>
§473<br>
<br>
"Karas,
upon his return to Greece, also received by the Protopsaltis, the
photograph of late Nikolaos Labadarios (Stogiannou) as well as
Nafpliotis' own photograph in order to take photos of them, and so as
take along the originals as well.</font><font>
The teacher has formed the opinion that Karas is an intellectual man
("logios") with a desire to work on the matters of our music, of which
music he happens to be a fan and supporter ("thiaswtis kai
yposthrikths"), although he doesn't master it ("an kai den thn
gnwrizei"). "<br>
<br>
§480 <br>
<br>
"Protopsaltis Ioan nis Byzantios, had
Pangiotis Kiltzanidis as a partner in his publications,. The
published
Anastasimatarion and Heirmologion of Ioannis Protopsaltis do not
contain the musical pieces as chanted in the Patriarchal church. Even
Ioannis himself did not follow the pieces of his Anastasimatarion:<span style=""> </span>he followed the tradition of the Patriarchal
