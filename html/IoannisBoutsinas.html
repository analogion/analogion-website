    <div class="text">(English) <p>
    Ioannis Boutsinas was born around 1900 in Constantinople. His father was the famous Constantinopolitan chanter
    Dimitrios Boutsinas, one of the teachers of Thrasyboulos Stanitsas. Ioannis Boutsinas' chant teacher was his father,
with whom he studied together with Thrasyboulos Stanitsas.
    In 1935 Boutsinas came to Crete where he was appointed the Protopsaltis of the church of St. Titus in Herakleion. Soon after
his arrival he got married and had two children from his marriage, Aglaia and Athena. In 1941 he was appointed the Protopsaltis 
of the Metropolitan Cathedral of St. Menas in Herakleion. Boutsinas remained in this position until 1970,
when he stopped chanting due to serious health problems. On July 14 of 1963 the Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras bestowed upon him
the offikion of Archon Protopsaltis of the Archdiocese of Constantinople. Boutsinas died in 1974 and was buried in Herakleion. Boutsinas
was distinguished by great vocal abilities and high-pitched voice. He had many students,
some of which are still chanting. At the same time Boutsinas was an apt composer of ecclesiastic hymns. He left many music manuscripts which remain unpublished
up to now.
