    <div class="question">
        What does the term "isokratema" mean?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> <b>Ison</b> ("ίσον") of a musical Mode
        is - by definition - the pitch of its basis (tonic). For instance, the ison of Second
        Soft Chromatic Mode is the note DI. To <b>hold</b> ("κρατώ") the ison means to continuouly
        sing the pitch of the basis while the melody of a hymn is being chanted by the psaltis.
        The person "holding the ison" is called the <b>isokratis</b> ("ισοκράτης") [plural
        <b>isokrates</b> ("ισοκράτες") or <b>isokratai</b> ("ισοκράται")].

        <br />
        a) To help the psalti learn and chant correct intervals. The co-sounding of the
        melody with the ison enhances the "idea" ["tin idea"] of the mode being chanted
        and helps the psalti apply the correct melodic attractions and intervals in general.
        <br />
        b) As a result of a) to help maintain the pitch of the basis of the mode throughout
        a (long) piece
        <br />
        c) As a result of a) to enhance the character of the mode being chanted and therefore
        contribute in transmiting the meanings of the melody the composer intended in places
        where modulation according to the meaning of the text takes place.
        <br />
        d) To enhance the beauty of chanting
        <br />
        e) To allow apprentice psaltai (and even non-psaltai) participate in chanting and
        learn by helping with holding the ison
        <br />
        f) To help cover up interval mistakes by the psaltis [Ref. Dimitrios Panagiotopoulos'
        theory book]

        <span class="name">G. K. Michalakis:</span> ...the most important, if not the only
        reason to have ison: To learn intervals and to chant correctly. Because in large
        churches, we have reverb.. Reverberation istself acts as ison, especially when using
        the "maradonna's foot" principle, where the most important notes of a passage are
        to be heard more than the rest. Once again we're into psycho-acoustics, whether
        you like it not ... for those chanting correct intervals, there can always be a
        slight dissonance on some occasions, where such notes are extended in durations
        (dissonant as to a previously emitted and continuously resonating note). One way
        to take care of this is to provide an ison, which will be in harmony with all the
        chanted notes: even an interval on plus one, (eg, Ni-Pa of Plagal Fourth mode) does
        *not* sound dissonant on an ison of Ni if Pa is chanted high enough, the way it's
        supposed to be chanted in psaltiki. All in all ison serves two purposes: Primarily
        (and most importantly) to help people learn correct intervals (this is so even in
        Hindu music) and, secondly, to cover up reverberating dissonances (and make things
        "sound nicer" as suggested above... when chanting in some non-resonating room, ison
        doesn't make things sound "any better"... it's just "extra noise". So, ison sounds
        better in some architectural context, namely that of a resonating volume.

    <div class="question">
        What is the origin of isokratema practice?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">S. Gugushvili:</span> The origin of isokratema practice is unclear.
        Marcel Peres has speculated that it actually could originate in the West and was
        subsequently borrowed by the Byzantines: "There is some evidence that this practice
        might come not from the Greek but from the Latin…. The use of the ison seems to
        be known in the Byzantine tradition around the fifteenth century, but not in other
        Eastern churches. The first clear description of this technique, though, comes from
        a Western source, the Micrologus by Guido d’Arezzo in the eleventh century. For
        him it was a sort of organum. He teaches us that this practice was common in Rome.
        We know from the Ordines Romani that by the seventh and eighth centuries there were
        traditions of organum singing in the pontifical chapel. Later the anonymous author
        of Summa Music, a treatise written around 1200, describes the sort of organum that
        consists of a drone. He calls this manner diaphona basilica: that’s very interesting,
        because the term basilica in liturgical matters often refers to the Roman tradition.
        So in the thirteenth century there was still in the vocabulary of singers a word
        that seems to referred [sic] to the Roman Basilican tradition and that means a vocal
        drone. It is very possible that the Greeks borrowed this practice from the Italian
        singers. We find in some fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Greek sources, written
        in Byzantine notation, some instances of polyphony in this style with parallel fifths
        and contrary motion. In one manuscript a rubric says, “This is done in the Italian
        way.” We know that from the thirteenth century the Italians, chiefly the Venetians,
        had a very strong influence in some regions like Crete and Byzantium itself, where
        there existed a Latin government for almost seventy years. So there is a strong
        basis for this scenario."        <p>
        </p>
        The criticism of Peres' opinion as far as existence of drone in the West is concerned
        can be found in Robert Howe's <a href="http://www.rob-rah.com/Downloads/MA.pdf">master
            thesis</a>, see pp. 6-8.
        <p>
        </p>
        <span class="name">I. Moody:</span> The article (actually a submission for a college
        degree) regarding this matter is quite a firm dismissal of the notion of the ison
        in Roman chant. The problem is that, in dismissing so summar ily the applicability
        of the terminology in this particular instance (and Peres's interpretation of the
        source), the author does not leave any room for the possibility of the ison being
        there at all. By coincidence, at the Colloquium on Mediaeval Monody currently being
        held in Lisbon and Evora, Professor Kenneth Levy gave today a very thought-provoking
        paper on the possibility of drones on Old Roman chant, based on a most exceptional
        neumatic occurence in a manuscript in London (BL Add. 29988). More is to be expected.

        <span class="name">I. Arvanitis:</span> "Diaphonia Basilica" is described in the
        treatise "Summa musice", written c. 1200. It is published with English translation
        by Christopher Page (Cambridge Univ. Press 1991): (p.124) : " Diaphonia is a manner
        of singing in two ways, and it is divided into 'basilica' and 'organica'. Basilica
        [diaphonia] is a manner of singing in two ways so that one singer continuously holds
        one note which is like a foundation melody for the other singer; his companion begins
        a chant either at the fifth or at the octave, sometimes ascending, sometimes descending,
        so that when he pauses he accords in some way with him who maintais the foundation"        'Organica' means contary motion of the voices. Summa musice mentions also "triphonia
        basilica", i.e. parallel fourths over a drone.

        <span class="name">Apostolos Konstas</span> , Book Title: "Apostolos Konstas o Chios
        and his contribution to the theory of the Music Art" Author: Thomas Apostolopoulos
        Editor Gr. Stathis, Atena, 2002, ISBN 960-86798-1-8, 364 p., 30x173x241mm (Details
        at <a href="http://www.csbi.ro/gb/recenzii.html">http://www.csbi.ro/gb/recenzii.html)</a>
        I quote: The well known theoretician Apostolos Konstas o Chios, writes in his theory
        book (ms EBE 1867) in 1800 AD: "... the ison of every mathema <b>which is held by the
            isokrates</b> is found (as with) all the isons of the modes between the authentic
        First mode and its low Heptaphonia (octave) the so called asiran". from the original
        Greek "to de ison kathe mathematos opou vasta o Isokraths euriskontai apanta ta
        isa twn hxwn apo ton kyrion hxon prwton, mexri tin katw eptafwnia autou, to legomeno
        asiran".
        <p>
        </p>
        So not only we have evidence of an isokratis "holding the ison", but also evidence
        that indeed the ison that is held should correspond to the ison of the mode i.e.
        the basis of the mode at any time.

        published with commentary by Halambos Karakatsanis [details pending]. He says in
        paragraph 79: "In any case, it is certain that the melody can sound nice and pleasing
        to the ear even when that octave harmony is not there because the whole art of harmony
        consists of this: to <b>hear notes ("fthoggous") together with those of lower pitch

        What is the earliest written down theory on isokratema?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> The earlier (somewhat brief) theory on
        isokratema is the one mentioned by Apostolos Konstas (see reference above) where
        he says that the isokratis holds the basis of the mode being chanted. After that,
        Father Charalambos Oikonomou gives a description of how isokratema should be done:
        <p>
        </p>
        (Translated by D. Koubaroulis).<br />
        <span class="name">Father Charalambos Oikonomou</span> from Cyprus wrote in his
        book "Byzantines Mousikes Chorde" in 1940 (paragraph 207): "So when the basis of
        the mode moves to a higher or lower dominant note or changes to another genre or
        system, doing cadences, the isokratis brings thes ison there, preferrably in the
        lower octave; isokratema in the high octave ("diapason") is not allowed. The isokrates
        co-chants with the psalti saying the syllables of the text with him and many times
        by a sign of the psaltis joins him in the intermediate or final cadences or he himself
        (the isokrates) does the cadences. During a chant, where the psalti may stop to
        breath, the isokrates is not allowed to disrupt the ison but he should change it
        to humming and resume it when the psalti continues the melody"        <p>

        There is also an analysis of isokratema in the theory book of Dimitrios Panagiotopoulos.

    <div class="question">
        What did Stylianos Tsolakidis (expressing Patriarchal practice at the time of Iakovos
        Nafpliotis) have to say about ison?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">G. K. Michalakis:</span> : [My teacher] Tsolakidis said <b>"ena einai
            to ison"</b>. In slow pieces, whether the melody ascends or descends, the ison
        remains the same, fixed on the basis and does not move. The canonarchs [of the Patriarchate]
        were allowed to change ison on some occasions, in general by triphonia (fourth)
        or tetraphonia (fifth), ver rarely diphonia (third). Those who were not initiated
        would keep the same ison, which suggests that <b>there might have been a form of double
            ison in the Patriarcheion</b>. In fast pieces (canon), the ison would involve
        the known "M" for "mazi" or "melody", meaning that in the descending, <b>below the ison
            part, the isocrate would sing along</b>. In slow pieces, things are bit more
        complicated. Recall, there were Isokratis, Domestichos, Canonarchos, etc... The
        first canonarchos was the only one allowed to do what the the "boithos" =helper
        Domestichos would do: sing along the various conclusion cadences. The first Domestichos
        would sing along almost 100%, except for difficult passages. My conclusions are
        the following: The patriarchal choirs were never 100% complete, for at Iakovos'
        time, there was lack of personnel. But imagine we have 10 isokratis, 3 canonarchos
        of which the first (for one octave higher voices), 2 helper domestichos and the
        first.. what can we do? We may do double ison, but the second, non basis ison will
        be much more disecreet than what is done by EBX... the "entrance" and "exit" is
        done with "progressive changes of intensity", and the overall volume of a second
        ison is only about 30 to 60% of that of the basis ... it is discreet.
        <p>
        </p>
        I add here what I had said elsewhere: when the number of chanters is limited to
        2, the one doing "ison" can do almost any other function: that of domestichos, canonarchos,
        ison, etc. In this case, when the melody "changes" to some new principal note (fthongos)
        the isokratis can change so as to "help" the teacher. This is the method that has
        remained in the "Patrarchal" ison of today, and which Stanitsas, and later on Vassilikos
        pushed to "extreme" = never-ending ison changes. When the choir was in complete
        form, the Protos canonarchos would change his recitation to the chord of the melodic
        line (for instance: in "ton pathon", ison is on Ni... the melody goes to Ga.. the
        Canonrchos does so, at "ta panta prosietai", and then comes back down to Ni for
        "tois prowkynousin en potho..). In choral form, the ison would stay on NI, in spite
        of the canonarchos' change of pitch. Yet, the canonarchos would do his ison at his
        pitch of recitation. This gives us a form of "double ison". In none of these situations
        does the canonarchos do a recitation on Pa or on Di = Pa (that is, he does not use
        a "dissonant" interval as to the basis, Ni in the first case, Ga in the second).
        <p>
        </p>
        Now, when chanting alone with the teacher, on lines of plagal fourth concluding
        on PA , or on Di = Pa, Tsolakidis would change his ison. He explained to me that
        when the choirs were at their fullest "Pascha, Acathistos", they'd apply the above-
        mentioned "isokratima" tactics. On other days (about 95% of the situations), the
        Protocanarchos would learn to change just as modern Stantisas-type of choirs in
        very limited manner... for instance, a simple Pa on plagal fourth, with no Low Di,
        no Bou, ... in other words, the only other ison allowed, except for tri/tetraphonia
        of the canonarch's recitation, was the dissonant (as to the main ison) fthongos,
        with no double ison (the canonarch's recitation was also the ison). eg: Idou o Nymphios
        argon: Recitation on Ga = Ni... changes to Pa for "alla ananipson krazousa". Just
        about when started learning the neumes, he had to learn by heart where to change
        the recitation for Iakovos. And here, we add the other very important purpose of
        ison: it's an <b>integration element</b> = it is used to initiate novices to psaltiki,
        so that they may progressively "blend in" and participate.
        <p>
        </p>
        "Ena einai to ison" does not come just from Tsolakidis, but from Iakovos... he would
        teach him to "change" ison in one or two places (and he even told me <b>when</b>
        Iakovos told him this... =when they were studying "ton Agion Pateron"), all in saying
        "kanonika, ena einai to ison" normally, <b>one</b> is the ison. the variable ison
        in a few positions, by the entire choir, and especially as concerns dissonant note
        as to the original ison is really to be considred as a concession. When he chanted
        "ton Nymphona sou", "makarios anir", etc, he would ask me to keep tha same ison,
        and not even to "chant along the lower than ison fthongos". Is pieces such as fourth
        stichiraric, ison = bou, and [co-chanting] "mazi" for descending lines. Quite honestly,
        this is one mode where it's hard to keep a constant Bou... the isokratis was always
        in advance on coming back to the BOU (the psaltis would not have to "imagine it),
        before the psaltis would go on chanting. third mode <b>always</b> GA, even if the
        melody would go beyond Ke.. or below Ga

        What does Lykourgos Angelopoulos (expressing the views of Simon Karas and his own

        Angelopoulos has written a very informative article on the subject [<a href="http://users.fth.sch.gr/sekyritsis/isokratima.htm">html</a>]

        but I have to mention my surprise that Angelopoulos does not refer to Apostolos
        Konstas when he talks about isokratema. Dimitrios Panagiotopoulos also mentions
        double isokratema and I don't think he was influenced by Karas. He is not mentioned
        either in the article. Finally the article seems to condemn modern practice on isokratema
        altogether and propose Karas' views as a sound alternative. There is no mention
        to the Patriarchal or Athonite practice at all. Also no mention on whether some
        pieces don't really need isokratema at all (despite the fact that he presents evidence
        from the Byzantine times supporting this claim).

        <span class="name">ISOKRATEMA TECHNIQUE IN MODERN PERFORMANCE PRACTICE</span>
        <br />
        by L. A. Angelopoulos (director of the Greek Byzantine Choir)
        <br />
        translated by D. Koubaroulis
        <p>
        </p>
        The term "isokratema" in Byzantine Music means the continuous horizontal co-sounding
        of the tonic of a mode or -more precisely- the tonic of a tetrachord or a pentachord
        with the melodic line. The word is composite: "ison" and "kratema". Sometimes we
        see only the word "ison" which means exactly the same thing, the "kratema" or "holding"        of the ison. In music, ison is the first and only sign of Byzantine notation that
        is characterised as "the beginning, middle and system of all signs of the Psaltic
        Art. Without ison, there is no voice ("fwnh" = melody?). Ison is called "aphonon"        (lit. mute) not because there isn't any melody associated with it. Ison can be counted
        ("metreitai") but not voiced ("fwneitai"). And depending on the amount of equal
        notes, the ison is chanted". That is found in all the prefaces of the theories of
        the old-method Papadike. From there it is, I think, that the etymology and literal
        meaning of the term "ison" derives: the continuous vocal repetition of the appropriate
        note each time, which note is called "ison", is the so called "holding of the ison"        that is, the "isokratema".
        <p>
        </p>
        It is well known that the musical system of Byzantine chant is monophonic, modal,
        purely vocal, written-down, with well known composers and compositions that are
        artistic and complete musical works even though they are intended almos exclusively
        for liturgical practice in Church - which of course is the centre of the Christian's
        life. However, there are also compositions that can be chanted outside the Church
        like, for instance, "at the table" which nonetheless is a continuation of liturgical
        congregation. Written tradition is interpreted by oral tradition and complemented
        by it. The microtonal variety and the effects of the signs are core elements of
        a complete interpretation. The isokratema, witnessed from the Byzantine times in
        manuscripts either with the mention of the name of the person that does it ("vastaktes"        = holder/supporter) or with the definition of the job of a "vastaktes". Having observed
        the above terminology in some compositions of manuscripts, I could conclude that
        not all pieces were changed with "vastaktes" but only those that explicitly said
        so. Equivalent to the "vastaktai" of the East in Western musical practice are: the
        four last members (out of the seven) of Scuola Cantorum, that is the archparaphonist
        and the three paraphonists (the first three members are the primicirius, secondarius
        and tertius). So much with the evidence of "vastaktai" (holders) of ison in the
        Byzantine period because, in my knowledge, there is no evidence of written isokratema
        in composition, in Byzantine as well as in the post-Byzantine period.
        <p>
        </p>
        After the introduction of the new method of the 3 teachers (beginning of the 19th
        cent) the first evidence of written isokratema in books dates around the beginning
        of the 20th century. It is quite surprising that the first notated isokratema in
        the 19th century is not found in books of the New Method (of the 3 teachers) but
        in those of another method called the "Lesvios' system" (a system that was justifiably
        rejected by the Ecumenical Patriarchate because it destroyed irreversibly the link
        between the practiced method and the older methods of the centuries-old musical
        system).
        <p>
        </p>
        A parenthesis: The huge importance of the connecting link between the older systems
        and the currently practiced one was pointed out and demonstrated first by Simon
        Karas with the identification of the effect of certain signs with oral (as well
        as written) tradition. Later research proves gloriously ("panygerika") the correctness
        and necessity of the views of Karas - let me mention the extremely well documented
        doctoral thesis of Georgios Konstantinou that was approved last year by the Ionian
        University. End of parenthesis. So the first notated isokratema in the 19th century
        happens by Georgios Lesvios in the book "Meliphonos Terpsinoe" a two-volume anthology
        published in Athens in 1847. The texts were "converted" as interpreted by Georgios
        Lesvios from the method of the 3 teachers, to his own method. In the preface of
        that work, Lesvios notes: "In the most well known pieces of the second volume, we
        added the signs of change of the bases (or the isa) which should co-chant softly
        ("ta opoia thelousi ypadein ypechountes (isokratwsi)" the "isokratai" while the
        piece is chanted as is observed by those chanting n Constantinople and indeed in
        the Great Church. However, they (dk: the isokratai) should also be musicians otherwise
        they can make mistakes". The phrase here "as it happens" creates some doubts as
        to whether Lesvios heard and wrote the isokratemata exactly as they were done in
        the Great church or that he notated them following in general and "approximately"        the standards and the tradition of the Great Church. Both assiptions are equally
        possible. The observation of this first evidence of written down isokratema is due
        to philologist M. Xatziyakoumis and took place while cataloguing the printed music
        books.
        <p>
        </p>
        I will not go into details regarding this notated isokratema as I have already given
        my texts to musicologist Sotirios K. Despotis, PhD candidate at the University of
        Vienna, who dealt in detail with the subject (for more information see his final
        year dissertation at the Ionian University titled "The application of the co-sounding
        ("synechetikou") system of Byzantine Ecclesiastical Music in Byzantine Ecclesiastical
        Melos through Theory and Practice of the 20th century", Corfu, 2002 and in a paper
        by the same author in the international conference of Vienna University (3-5 Oct.
        2002): "Die Isokratema Praxis der Byzantinischen Kirchnmusik"). In 1902, the Protopsaltis
        of Smyrna, Misael Misaelidis publishes his "Neon Theoretikon" consisting of 3 parts:
        1) About our Ecclesiastical music 2) About Ancient Greek Music and 3) Various Ecclesiastical
        Hymns etc. In the third part and from page 63 onwards, where the per-mode Cherouvika
        start, a capital I is written on the notes that the isokrates should change the
        ison. Much later, in 1924, Stylianos Hourmouzios of Cyprus will use the same method
        (capital I) with the same meaning in his book "Ecclesiastical Salpingx", vol. 3,
        Liturgy.
        <p>
        </p>
        In the years of activity of the Patriarchal Committee of 1881-1883 we can identify
        a trend to seek a more systematic manner of co-sounding of the melodic line and
        the isokratema. Central figure in that attempt is the Fanariot (Constantinopolitan)
        Archimandirte Germanos Afthonidis, president of the Commitee. A very interesting
        piece of information that involves Germanos was kindly offered by Protopsaltis and
        researcher Konstantinos Markos. In a text by well known French musician L. Bourgault-Ducoudray,
        the translation of which will be published by K. Markos soon, it is mentioned that
        Ducoudray had repeatedly met and discussed with Afthonidis on the possibility of
        some kind of co-sounding support for the melodic line. Ducoudray suggested some
        solutions but without success because Germanos would not accept them. In the end,
        the French musician suggested to Germanos two co-sounding lines (deux harmonisations)
        which Germanos accepted and they named them due to their primitive simplicity (vu
        leur simplicite primitive) as "diplo ison" ("double ison"). I do not have any more
        information on the fate of that work but quite possibly that could have been the
        inspiration of the double supporting or co-sounding line promoted by K. Psaxos when
        he came to Athens from Constantinople, as the first teacher of the newly founded
        School of Byzantine Ecclesiastical Music of the Athens Conservatory (1904) .
        <p>
        </p>
        On Psahos' double co-sounding line we observe the following: 1. He doubles parts
        of the melody in unison or an octave apart which results in the ison to lie in the
        middle and the melody to move higher or lower than the ison. When the second voice
        moves, the third is holding the ison and vice-versa, when the third voice moves,
        the ison is done by the second voice. 2. In this case the two voices chant together
        (in unison) while the third holds the ison 3. All three voices chant in unison,
        without isokratema. The above cases are observed in both syllabic and melismatic
        pieces. In particular, the melismatic pieces differ in the melodic lines that are
        suitable for solo ("kalofwnia"). In such a case, the ison is held by the second
        or third voice in unison or as double ison (dk: two different notes). The in-depth
        study of the system of the 8 modes as well as the effects of the notation signs,
        led Simon Karas to build a teaching that gives clear, complete and justified answers
        to the issue at hand. In general, I could say that in the first half of the 20th
        century, the trend for some kind of enrichment of the isokratema, in order to counter
        the increasing popularity of Western polyphony, is quite strong. And Simon Karas
        himself goes a long way in a short period of time, from the first recording of 1930
        (by Melpo Merlie) until the formation of his teaching on isokratema, on the basis
        of the system of the modes and the effects of the signs of the notation. The operation
        of "double isokratema", as he names it, is different from the co-sounding line ("synhxhtikh
        grammh") of Psaxos. Double isokratema of Simon Karas exists when there are common
        notes when moving from one mode to another inside a piece, with adjacent ("synhmmena")
        tetrachord (e.g. in cases of moving from low First Mode or Plagal Second Mode to
        Papadic Fourth Mode Agia). Whichever change of the isokratema has to follow the
        musical phrase from the beginning, something which often is not so clearly visible
        and easy. Especially in cases where a musical phrase can belong to more than one
        mode, depending on how it is chanted, applying the characteristic elements of this
        or the other mode. The structure of the pieces plays an important role as to the
        placement of the isokratema. In his "Theoretikon", S. Karas has a detailed teaching
        on the isokratemata of all modes for someone who wants to read more on this subject.
        <p>
        </p>
        Modern psaltic practice appears contradicting with respect to isokratema. On one
        hand there is a will for study, research and to follow all the rules of our musical
        system. On the other hand, one can see a carelessness ("proxeirothta") and adapting
        to the existing dead-end practices of education and knowledge. The worst is the
        view of isokratema using the logic of Western music and of vertical harmony which
        has absolutely no relation to our musical system. And even worse, the influence
        of such logic at the practical level, in cases where there is no knowledge of Western
        music but a modern aesthetic understanding which gets infuenced by Western and/or
        Eastern sources and remains captive to manufactured sounds ("typopoihmena akousmata")
        that do not take into account neither the modal system nor the effects of the notation
        signs. The in-depth study, complete knowledge of the structure and operation of
        the system of the Octoechos (8 modes) as well as the effects of the notation signs
        is required for a justified documentation of isokratema.

        It's this varialbe intensity of the ison that draws attention to a particular word

        When should isokratema start and stop?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> No hard and fast rules. I follow the practice
        of L. Angelopoulos, starting the isokratema on the last note of the apechema and
        ending it at the end of the melody together with the psaltis. Isokratema may stop
        at cadences if there is one isokratis and needs to catch his breath. In other times,
        isokratema may stop between parts of a piece e.g. between the main piece and its
        associated kratema etc.
        <p />
        <span class="name">T. Nassis:</span> Closer attention to the expertise of the EBX
        will show that within slower, papadic melodies all the isokrates may need to break
        and take a breath if they need to. For example, at the their successful Nov 2005
        concert in Boston, the entire choir broke before and after the te-ri-rem of the
        koinonikon "Lytrosin Apestelai." Isokrates are not robots, and need to be respected
        as artists in their own right.

        Should the isokratema be stopped at cadences?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> Further to the answer of the previous
        question, it happens quite often in modern studio and concert recordings of choirs
        like the one of Thrasyvoulos Stanitsas. The usual argument is that the isokrates
        need to catch their breaths and rest especially in long pieces. Other more conservative
        choirs (like the Greek Byzantine Choir) do not generally stop the isokratema at
        cadences. It seems to be a matter of taste. I prefer continuous isokratema at the
        cadences to avoid the "hiccups" sound produced by stopping isokratema and melody
        together, especially when done too abruptly as experienced by a few modern choirs.

        Should the priest's ekphoneses be accompanied by isokratema?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> No. Ekphoneses are not hymns even though
        some priests unfortunately extend them to elaborate melodies to which the psaltai
        hold ison from their places. When a priest (or bishop) is chanting a hymn then isokratema
        can be held for them by the isokrates.

        Who introduced mechanical (synthesized) isokratema in recordings and is it allowed?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> The earliest recordings we have with synthesized
        isokratema are from the CD "Music of the Greek Orthodox Church 1924-1930" published
        by FM Records in Greece. Listen to the recordings by Petros Maneas and Konstantinos
        Thomaidis for instance.

    <div class="question">
        Who introduced mechanical (synthesized) isokratema in Church services and is it
        allowed?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> The first mechanical isokratis designed
        for use in Church was developed by Georgios Naoum, a well known psaltis from Athens.
        Since the, others have also constructed such machines. Theodoros Vasilikos is the
        most well known protopsaltis that uses such a machine in the service. Many traditional
        psaltai and Bishops have condemned the use of mechanical isokratema in church and
        as a result its spread is very limited.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        What is the role of the isokratis (the person that "holds" the ison)?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">G. K. Michalakis:</span> First, to participate, second to learn
        and third, to "help out"...
        <p>
        </p>
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> I agree. Where "helping out" means to
        help fulfil the purposes of isokratema mentioned earlier.

    <div class="question">
        Does the existence of isokratema contradict the claim that Psaltiki is monophonic?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> [pending]
        <p>
        </p>
        <span class="name">G. K. Michalakis:</span> No... because one needs to have a unique,
        steady ison to learn intervals correctly. Once learnt, these intervals can be chanted
        with or without ison. It's the overall "acoustics" that will determine the necessity
        of its use in actual sevices.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        Should the isokratema be written down at all?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">G. K. Michalakis:</span> Never... using notes is mechanical enough.
        adding bar lines and ison is a nice way of turning people into robots.
        <p>
        </p>
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> It is useful in teaching and learning.
        However, once someone is experienced enough they do not need to have isokratema
        notated to perform it correctly. This is, in my opinion, the reason why the classical
        books do not have isokratema notated.

        to notate the isokratema in Church books other than for teaching purposes.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        Why isokratema is not heard consistently in Patriarchal services?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">G. K. Michalakis:</span> If they're losing chronos, it's natural
        that there are less people interested in chanting some constant note... (this is
        just an additional factor to the continuously diminishing Greek population of Constantinople)...
        <p>
        </p>
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> I would also attribute it to the diminishing
        population and the attention shift to "save as much as we can" which does not include
        ison (perhaps as something not as vital as other elements of practice).
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        What are the different schools of thought regarding isokratema?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> It'd be good to establish category names
        for the different types of ison schools:
        <br />
        - basic ison (=only the basis of the mode)
        <br />
        - conservative ison (=tetrachords/pentachord and mode changes only)
        <br />
        - moving ison (=conservative ison + some vertical harmonisation similar to Stanitsas's
        scores)
        <br />
        - westernised ison (=vertically harmonised ison)
        <p>
        </p>
        When double ison is used one could say "double conservative ison" or "double moving
        ison". Are there more categories? Any better names for the categories above?
        <p>
        </p>
        <span class="name">G. K. Michalakis:</span> We just read them above (L. Angelopoulos'
        article).<br />
        <b>double</b>: unique, continuous ison, with added secondary ison on triphony and
        tetraphony.
        <br />
        <b>single with conservative changes</b>, with anticipation on dissonant notes (as
        compared to the mode's basis)
        <br />
        <b>single, with "generous" ison changes </b>(Stanitsas/Vassilikos/Zoe): from left
        to right, their intervals start changing, and I suggest that this is so because
        of the changing ison, (from the psaltic to the Western tempered scale). Classical
        examples are the "diatonic KE" becoming lower, the Bou higher, and, of course, the
        Pa lower. Changing from GA to Ke on third mode has completely abolished the beautiful
        pitches of DI, KE, Zo, Ni PA of third mode, bringing them all down.
        <br />
        <b>multiple </b>(Psachos) triphonic (add to that the organ of American churches),
        with occidental intervals polyphonic (tetraphonic) = slavonic style.
        <p>
        </p>
        I don't find it hard to imagine that perhaps there were chants back then that would
        sound as beautiful as Georgian or even Corsica harmonisations using PSALTIC intervals.
        I don't feel that polyphony could not have existed... it could not have existed
        with Western and Simonokaraitic intervals. But once Kyriakos Tsiappoutas will give
        us all of the Iakovos intervals, I will try to harmonise some piece using melodos...
        and I think that the result will be amazing...

    <div class="question">
        What is the "synechetike gramme" (co-sounding line) proposed by Konstantinos Psahos

    <div class="answer">
        See L. Angelopoulos' article above.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        Is isokratema "easy" and "cheap" (as once heard) and should it be left to untrained
        psaltai?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> No it is not easy. To do it properly it
        requires musicality, knowledge of the music and the text being chanted, psaltic
        experience,and good aesthetic criterion. It requires vocal and breathing stamina
        and very good pitch. Untrained psaltai can do isokratema as long as there is someone
        to guide them as to when and where to they should change.
        <p />
        <span class="name">T. Nassis:</span> Any serious and talented chanter and isokrati
        will tell that there are many tricks to the trade of performing great isokratima.
        To believe like some that isokratima is easy just isn't true. (I was embarassed
        to hear Taliadoro arrogantly say to his isokrates in my very presence, "To isokratima
        einai ftino.") The 'secrets' are many.
        <p />
        <span class="name">S. Herron:</span> I, having to teach and chant in America where
        trained chanters are a large deficiency, am much in favor of having untrained psaltis
        hold isokratima and my reasons personally are VERY practical: 1) It gives the "students"        something to do, 2) it forces them to pay attention to what is being chanted and
        they become more interested and listen to the piece and I believe retain more of
        the piece and tone 3) and on a very practical level it keeps them interested and
        feel like they are contributing when they are not advanced enough to actually chant
        themselves. Unfortunately, many would lose interest if I made them stand there and
        listen. Now while it may be different in places with highly trained chanters like
        the Patriarchate or Agia Eirini (despite the many criticisms of the style, the chanters
        have by all means been schooled very well on the Karas method there) or anywhere
        else with a high quantity of chanters, but I see no problem in having beginners
        or untrained psaltis hold isokratima, in fact, I think it is something where it
        will be spiritually beneficial to them and practically beneficial in learning the
        music.

    <div class="question">
        How should isokratema be notated (when it is notated)?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> It is better to be done discreetely avoiding
        fancy colours, bold letters and circles and preferably in black or red ink (which
        is more consistent with manuscript tradition). Good examples of notating isokratema
        are the scores of the Greek Byzantine Choir.

    <div class="question">
        How should isokrates train to do their job?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> Initially, in teaching, they should be
        presented with scores with notated isokratema. In Church, there should be a master
        isokratis responsible for the trainees and help them with when and how should change
        the ison everytime the mode chanted changes. The psaltis should supervise and correct
        the performance of the isokrates at all times.

        <p>

        Should the apechema be accompanied by ison?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">G. K. Michalakis:</span> Why, then, call it apechema ("outside"        or "derivative" of...echos = melody)
        <p>
        </p>
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> Lykourgos Angelopoulos says no (as it
        contradicts the main reason of the apechema which is exactly to provide the pitch
        of the ison to the isokratai), except for the last note of the apechema which is
        the actual note to be help by the isokrates and on which note isokratema starts,
        blending the apechema and the main piece and preparing the melody to start shortly
        after. I personally like and encourage this practice.</div>
    <div class="question">
        Can ison change for the duration of a single note only e.g. like in temporary cadences

        <span class="name">G. K. Michalakis:</span> No
        <p />
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> Most psaltai do change the ison in cases
        where they think that the mode temporarily changes even on one single note and usually
        to avoid dissonance resulting in a form of vertical harmonisation. If ison is held
        discreetly one should not have to change in such cases and the dissonance is not
        noticable or adds some "surprise" element to the experience of the listener.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        What is the right isokratema when the melody stops and rests in BOY of Plagal First

    <div class="answer">
        <p>
        </p>
        <span class="name">G. K. Michalakis:</span> PA.... BOY should be in it's psaltic
        position (yet, we add as "diesis reminder" which psycho-acoustically is treated
        as =push up the BOY... but the BOY is where it should be... with no "push", it may
        become slightly low and dissonant).
        <p>
        </p>
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> Practice varies. PA seems like the most
        traditional choice there. Well known choirs like the Greek Byzantine Choir do a
        low KE (reasons pending) and the Maistores do BOY (joining melos). [More details

    <div class="question">
        Why did Nafpliotis, Pringos, Stanitsas (in Constantinople) and Dositheos recorded
        many or all of their material without isokratema?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">G. K. Michalakis:</span> Because they knew their intervals inside
        out... Especially Iakovos. Ison has helped me "place my voice" when I forget. But
        for pieces I know "inside out", I've started recording without ison... I add an
        ison later (before, I'd most often use the ison even during recordings, although
        it is not heard in the recordings). I don't know why yet, but the end result is
        better without the simultneous ison (only for pieces i know... for pieces I don't
        know, the ison helps me determine an overall "balance " among the various pitches.
        The ison helps one to obtain "natural, psaltic intervals".
        <p>
        </p>
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> We do not know with certainty why they
        didn't use isokratema, We can only guess. Possible explanations:
        <br />
        a) They thought that ison was not needed once they had learnt good intervals, not
        caring about its "beautifying" role or its actual use in Church practice
        <br />
        b) Their isokrates were trained to do ison ad hoc which would not sound well in
        a studio recording where a systematic approach would be required for a "professionally
        uniform" performance.
        <br />
        c) The recording technology did not support many people chanting together (?)
        <br />
        d) They wanted to show that ison "does not formally exist" in Church recordings
        and is only used for learning (although that contradicts the claim that some of
        those recordings were "paedagogical")
        <br />
        e) The recordings were done informally or "on the spot" and there was no time to
        find trained isokrates
        <br />
        f) They wanted to showcase their performance as clearly as possibly, not mixed with
        (possibly occasionaly out of tune) isokratema
        <p>
        </p>
        Or (my personal take) a mixture of the above.</div>

    <div class="question">
        When isokratema is changing, is it subjective as to where exactly it will change
        (assuming the tetrachord/pentachord rules are respected)?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">G. K. Michalakis:</span> What counts most is the text, and not
        the melody...for a same line with different words, the ison change will change according
        to the words and its accents..Occidentals don't understand this but that is what
        Xerodimas taught me.

        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> In practice yes, it is subjective depending
        on the isokratis, but there are limits and traditional isokratema knowledge is a
        prerequisite. Others put more emphasis on the change of text (as mentioned above).
        Others on the melodic phrases and use those to change the ison. Others (including
        myself) try to do both, when possible and prefer that there is a master isokratis
        (or psaltis) who guides the rest of the isokratai as to when they should change.

    <div class="question">
        How did Karas arrive at his theory on ison (tetrachordal usually, double ison, very
        precise and mechanical, in EBX they have about 6 or more members assigned to just
        that) and what were his sources?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> That is explained in Angelopoulos' article
        about isokratema (see above). Karas did not invent the double ison theory but he
        was the one who made it popular. And Angelopoulos even more.</div>
    <div class="question">
        What makes the difference between a solid Ke and a Pa-Ke (double ison)? Such as
        in say the Christmas Koinonikon sometimes the EBX move the whole isokratima and
        other times it is double. What is the basis for when it is and isn't double?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> When the basis of the current tetrachord/pentachord
        and the basis of the mode are a tetra/penta/octachord away from each other then
        one can theoretically apply double ison. The second ison is always meant to be softer
        than the main one. When two isons are applied, the lower pitch one is always the
        main one. I just made up this rule from experience. I don't know if anyone (Karas?)
        has written something about it.
        <p />
        An exception to the rule is the example of First Mode doing temporary endings in
        low ZW. Or Second mode doing endings in BOY. I haven't heard EBX doing double ison
        in those or similar cases.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        Some observations from reading the notes on the page plus prior discussion and knowledge
        shared: 1) Isokratima seems to have never really been scientifically used or practiced
        to anywhere near the level of Karas and his students before him. This does not make
        me say Karas is better, in fact I think how they came up with that style of isokratima
        shows a lot of what can be good and bad with his method. He apparently looked at
        all the different practices, read as much theory on it as was available, and decided
        this was good and that was bad and then streamlined it. The good thing is that he
        then had a scientific, applicable systematized theory on how to use isokratima and
        how to apply it to a choir. The bad of it is 1) was it meant to be systematized?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> Is Byzantine Chant at all meant to be
        systematised? I think yes to some extent but there is no absolute answer (to me
        at least). My personal belief is that systematising doesn't mean steamrolling all
        variations into one and only acceptable prototype. Systematising is good in the
        form of presenting traditional alternatives (something I have tried to do with analogion.com)
        and pointing out the limits to what is non-traditional.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        So the approach Karas and his followers theoretically try to take is "This is one
        of many ways to chant traditionally" and that their approach to isokratima is the
        same. Correct?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> Yes.But the philosophy is that from the
        many traditional ways, Karas' proposal was and is the "state of the art". :-)
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        In Karas' systematic approach, while based on what he viewed as traditional sources
        , things are edited through his and only his thoughts and decisions and end up not
        sounding like anything else that was out there, which begs the question, how can
        it be traditional if it sounds like nothing else being done at the time or before
        that time (as best one can tell)?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> I don't think Karas' isokratema sounds
        that much different from anything else out there. The systematic application of
        certain "rules" (and of double ison) and "concert" quality of the isokratema distinguishes
        it from other recordings perhaps.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        What qualified, in Karas' eyes, as a traditional source for isokratima and a non-traditional
        source? I may be worng, but I dont think he lays that out.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> His main concern was to fight against
        the introduction of vertically-harmonised isokratema which started to become very
        popular in the 20th century. He clearly identifies that as non-traditional and proposes
        his method. But it is true, he doesn't say enough about the subject.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        It seems that some chanters whose interpretations on pieces are viewed as credible
        by Karas are completely rejected by some other psaltai as untraditional and wrong.
        How can a psaltis who has apparently been taught enough to give a traditional interpretation
        of a piece be so wrong in their isokratima usage when the theory of isokratima was
        so unsystematized before Karas? Here I am referring to people like Stanitsas, Karamanis
        and such. I believe (I could be way off on this) Karas said, and I believe I got
        this from an email posted by Ioannis Arvanitis on the byzantinechant list but maybe
        he was just saying his own thoughts, that the books of Karamanis were good to learn
        interpretation, but not good because they weren't as formulaic, but Karamanis writes
        what he chants so if he does that and his books are good to learn interpretation,
        then he respected his interpretation, and yet his isokratima is regarded as untraditional.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> Unsystematised doesn't mean each psaltis
        did as they wish (talking about the trained ones). There were unwritten rules (as
        with many other things in Psaltiki). For instance quick changes of isokratema inside
        a melodic phrase were not traditional in the older days (listen to older Patriarchal
        recordings). Nowadays we hear them all the time from modern protopsaltai and choirs.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        At least with interpretation and such there has been a lot written and said on what
        is and what isn't before that time. How this relates to his whole method and the
        questions that arise are these for me: If he studied the isokratima so in depth
        (which he obviously did) and then scientifically developed the "proper" way to perform
        isokratima, why then does it sound so much different from anything else out there
        at the time? And here is what I mean by "so different". Despite what GKM wrote,
        which I believe is true and such, I do not think double ison was very common and
        I think it was probably a very rare occurrence and never planned, so most of the
        time it would have been just a solid note. None of the Patriarchal recordings have
        that. Fr. Dositheos doesn't do it. The tetra/pentachordal style system, while some
        perform it, a lot of traditional recordings don't. In a recording of the Kekragaria
        Argai in Tritos chanted by Bamboudakis it rarely moves. Fr. Dositheos recordings
        rarely have movement like that.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> Exactly. Karas tried to describe this
        practice of double ison that he experienced and thought that it could be presented
        formally. There is nothing wrong with that. On the contrary, it gives us a new understanding
        of Psaltic reality and a reference point to compare approaches and talk about things.
        And from what I remember, Karas only said that one "may" do double ison temporarily
        if they want so. He didn't say that it is how things should be done. Trying to systematically
        apply this formal proposal to each and every possibility of a double ison occuring,
        changing the music texts to notate it, having special people in the church choir
        to do the double ison... then it becomes a different story and I agree with you.
        It loses its spontaneous and organic character and becomes a technical exercise
        that results in concert-like chanting inside the church which is a debatable goal.
        That's my personal opinion. Others may find it a step forward in the Psaltic Art.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        If this is true for isokratima, which while not easy is definitely basic in comparison
        with the melos itself, then how can this not have happened within his [Karas'] whole
        method? Of over-systematically analyzing the traditions and in many ways destroying
        the organic ways of the tradition itself.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">S. Herron:</span> The descriptions GKM gave of what Tsolakidis
        said of isokratima makes double ison and such very "organic" so to speak in nature.
        It happened not because the sign said "Pa-Ke_ but because some students knew when
        to move it and others didn't so they had the ones who didnt keep holding the basis,
        and thats what formed. There is a certain beauty in that way of double ison developing
        I find that is taken out of it when laid out in the way Karas has. It takes out
        the organic nature of how these things developed and how traditions developed. The
        good though, with isokratima, is that now it gives one something that somebody can
        teach and that a student can read and quickly get someone up to speed on how the
        isokratima should be done. It eliminates the initial guesswork, which is how I believe
        many of the different variations of style began and lead to the near polyphonic
        nature of some isokratis (Bassilikos comes to my mind). I think this is a good thing,
        because I would much prefer the isokratima of EBX, Ioannis Arvanitis, the Bilalis
        brothers, etc., etc. than the isokratima of Bassilikos, Taliadoros, Simonopetra
        and such.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        In the Kekragarion of the First Mode cadences on Zo (so we can say the melody did
        cadence on Barys and can justify the change of ison). Can we still keep Pa ison
        throughout the piece?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> Different schools of thought apply here
        and I don't think there is right or wrong. You can traditionally do three things:
        <p />
        a) co-chant the cadence. This is my preferred approach and it seems what is fairly
        common Patriarchal and Athonite practice.
        <br />
        b) change ison to ZW for the duration of the cadence to indicate the implied change
        of mode (from First Mode to Barys). This is what most trained choirs do.
        <br />
        c) keep ison on PA (but at low volume so that it doesn't intervene with the melody
        which technically is in another mode). When I say this is traditional it means I
        have heard it many times when isokrates are being very conservative in their changes (see schools of isokratema thought above) or 
        they simply do not know much about changing modes and the only thing they know is keep the 
        basis. It doesn't sound that bad at all when ison is discreet.
