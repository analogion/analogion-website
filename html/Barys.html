    <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">What is Barys Diatonic and why it is called like
        that?</span><br>
    <br>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Barys Diatonic</span> is the mode whose basis
        (ison) is low ZW diatonic. Because its basis is lower than any other Ecclesiastical
        mode (except for Barys Enharmonic from low ZW yphesis) it is called Barys (lit.
        Heavy, Low, Grave) mode. [Exception: Some believe that pieces of Barys Heptaphonos
        (starting and ending on high ZW') should belong to a mode that is not called <span            style="font-style: italic;">Barys </span>but <span style="font-style: italic;">Oxys
            </span>(lit. High, Sharp) to reflect the fact that it has the highest basis
        of all other modes [Ref. Fr Ch. Oikonomou]] [Exception: Some modern Leitourgika
        have been composed in Plagal First mode based on low KE]. The name Barys refers
        to a family of sub-modes (modal branches or just branches) which is described below
        in more detail.
        <br>

    <br>
    <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">. Is Barys Diatonic a Plagal or an Authentic mode?<br>
        <br>
    </span>
    <div class="text">
        <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Noone really
            knows. If an Authentic mode, what is its Plagal? If a Plagal, what is its Authentic?
            It clearly has a relationship with Legetos (cadences to and from Legetos on low
            ZW diatonic and cadences of Legetos to upper ZW diatonic) but what is this relationship
            in Plagal/Authentic terms? And what mode is Legetos any way? Sometimes Legetos is
            called Second Diatonic (i.e. an Authentic Mode, e.g. in Mousike Pandekte), others
            (like S. Karas) call it Plagal Second Diatonic (read his rational in the epistle
            of I. Plemmenos to cmkon.org [doc]) According to Karas, Barys Heptaphonos is the
            ancient Second Soft Diatonic Authentic mode of the Byzantine times (see his arguements
            in his Theoretikon). To make things worse, there are many branches (types) of Barys
            Diatonic each one different from each other (see below). Are they all Plagal or
            Authentic or what are they? Chysanthos uses the word "chroa" instead of "mode" to
            describe Barys Heptaphonos (as used by Daniel Protopsaltis in his slow Doxology).
            Then, at least for that branch of Barys, the question becomes, is a chroa a Plagal
            or an Authentic mode? Is it a mode at all? It is all very obscure at the moment
            to me.</span></span><br>

    A. Boudouris says that Tetraphonos has GA natural and DI flat (DK: said to be equivalent
    to maqam Bestengar)<br>
    <br>
    S. Karas (at al) says that Tetraphonos has GA sharp and DI in its place and describes
    Bestengar as a special case of Protobarys with GA natural and DI flat.<br>
    <br>
    K. Psaxos doesn't even refer to Tetraphonos and gives only one scale with GA sharp
    for all Barys (because he reckons the imperfect pentachord ZW-GAnatural is "not
    acceptable by nature"). He says that GA is natural only in lines of First (or Plagal
    First) mode.<br>
    <br>
    D. Panagiotopoulos (again if I recall correctly) implies that Tetraphonos has GA
    natural and doesn't speak about the DI flat.<br>

    <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">So we have issues. Here's some

    <span class='name'>3. What type of Barys is Gregorios' doxology written
        in according to the previous definitions?</span><br>
    <br>
    The score indicates "Tetraphonos" and explicitly has DI yphesis (flat) at places.<br>
    <br>
    <span class='name'>4. Is Stanitsas correct in doing GA sharp and no DI
        flat in the doxology (although their DI sounds slightly lower than natural DI)?</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Note that even Fourth mode Agia has GA natural in theory but what happens in practice
    is very different. GA is most of the time raised, attracted by DI.<br>

            in the above examples natural of sharp (or both depending on the phrase)? </span>
        <br>
        To me, it sounds sharp, sharper than what we would do in First mode normally, but
        not as sharp as in Barys Heptaphonos (where the melodic attraction pushes GA even
        higher).

        <br>
        <div class="text">
            I just listened to the Doxologia by Stanitsas. His apechema is a STANDRAD Protobarys,
            with NO special intervals.... PA is in its "Chrysanthos" diatonic position, beginning
            to end. We do hear a nice Ni-Zo in the end. However, the choir does bring down the
            "PA" a bit (not enough to my liking" in " anthropois eucokIIIIIIa". In the "Doxa
            soi", they not only bring down Di, but Ga a bit a well. However, they can't keep
            the "special intervals" throughout, and the piece does NOT sound like the Barys
            of Sfikas or Proussalis... The determining factor is Pa and BOU, which they cannot
            keep LOW enough at all times... and the piece is no longer the "special" barys,
            and it is not the PROTOBARYS either (where Pa, Bou, Ga are in their NATURAL diatonic
            positions, EXCEPT the conclusions on Zo, where we lower Pa slightly = special intervals).
            So, the real question isn't about Ga diesis in itself, but about Ga diesis in RELATION
            to ALL sorts of SHIFTED intervals....<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="text">
            So, those who focus on ONE note without realising the BEAUTIFUL intervals done by
            MANY-shifted notes (which I have amply described, and all I got in return is "disagreement",
            with NO one offering an example to accompany their "legetos" or xe-legetos or Ga-diesis
            Karas et al affabulations = made-up stories) are missing out on this "serious, sweetly
            tenebrous mode" which is of exceptional beauty and which NO instrument other than
            human voice can express correctly.<br>

            Thank you for the Sfikas and Proussalis recordings... I'm not alone out there singing
            the "special intervals". And listen to how Sfikas also "drags down" the UPPER Zo-Ni-Pa
            intervals, when shifting to hepthphonos. The melodic line is that which we find
            in plagal fourth and even in plagal first.. yet, the INTERVALS are different. Now,
            if we need to go BEYOND that with NORMAL Pa intervals, the classical authors will
            put a fthora of BOU on Zo (or Zo diatonic fthora on the UPPER UPPER Ga= Zo, thus
            Bou = Ke, Pa= Di, etc), just like in the kallophonikos heirmos "Tas kakotheisas"            by Anonymos, page 143. Also note in this composition, the initial syneptegmenos
            "shifted" measures that fall back onto their feet (just like "Anympheute" in "Ti
            hypermacho"). Pringos and Stanitsas do not maintain special intervals throughout
            their Barys, so I wouldn't use them as references for either pure probarys vs. special
            intervals barys. As for all the other psaltis, as far as Barys is concerned, "if
            it isn't Giannis, it's Giannakis"...<br>

            In all these pieces, we are NOT dealing with POTOBARYS and we are NOT dealing with
            "special intervals". We are dealing with "sabach or even ousak" that just simply
            go down to Zo. The Ni and PA are in their NORMAL diatonic positions. Di is lowered
            to GA in its normal diatonic position. Bou is not too raised, so we're not really
            in Spatheion. for instance:
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class='name'>bestenegar_pesrev</span>: the initial long note
            is our GA.... Bou here is a bit high, and we have spatheion in just one measure...
            Then Bou is normal, PA in its NORMAL (high) diatonic position...<br>
            <br>
            <span class='name'>Cemil-bestenigar-pesrev</span>: Starting from ga,
            we hear a DI and Ke enharmonic all the way to Zo... then back to Ga, with Di later
            on hyphesis... and the melody stagnates on Ga (polar note), with quick passage to
            diatonic Pa, and then diatonic Zo. The string and bow do Ga di ga bou pa, typical
            of the FIRST MODE (the one most of you like calling "diphonos"... the PA is in its
            position...), and typical of the line Shota scanned and put up.
            <br>
            <br>
            To my ears, most of these musicians are quite coherent, (except for ney_bestenegar_taqsim).
            But their mode has NOTHING to do with Barys as sung by Sfikas, and Proussalis, Tsolakidis
            at times, and Xerodemas. I feel that we should NOT mix up VOCAL with instrumental
            music... The ONLY corrections that need to be made in psaltiki are those of all
            contemporary and auto-didact psaltis and their followers, who should listen to old
            recordings and correct THEIR perception of psaltiki... the Turks know what their
            doing with their instruments... so do the Greeks... but the psaltis should learn
            from CREDIBLE psaltis, and not<br>
            from some instrument..<br>

            <br>
        </span>
        <div class="text">
            I just finished listening to Stephanos Proussalis: EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT.. hyphos,
            chronos, EVRYTHING... even good Barys "special" intervals. Does anyone know who
            he learned from? He sounds very much like the monk Dositheos. And Sfikas... yes,
            we have EXCELLENCE here as well... BEAUTIFUL "special" intervals. Now, what do the
            interpretations of these two psalits, (and you may add mine, as well) have to do
            with either LEGETOS or all the other "theories" running around, especially from
            Karas et al.<br>
            <br>
            I get the impression that ONLY occidental musicians can understand Karas' "descriptions".
            Andrea, for instance, would agree that Sfikas' intervals are good, special intervals.
            She was the one who actually sat down and demonstrated to me on paper what I was
            doing., But I really DON'T understand how she agrees with Karas' descriptions....<br>
            <br>
            As for the Apostolos "spatheion Ga, Kliton Di", she had NEVER read of it anywhere...
            not even in Karas' manual... So, I put up one of the messages I had posted in the
            past to describe the "special intervals" of Barys diatonikos. There are so many
            barys diatonikos schools that one has to make one's proper "synthesis".<br>
            <br>
            There are those who sing as LEGETOS at Zo, and I will not even quote them, but they
            have had traditional and respectable teachers (I was referring to Andrea). But acoustically,
            they don't manage to convince me. Then there are those that pull down Di to Ga,
            and keep Pa in place. They either do an EPITROPI PA, close so Ni, in turn close
            to Zo, OR they do a CHRYSANTHOS PA, quite distant from Ni, this Ni being still close
            to Zo.<br>
            <br>
            I guess that the issue about Ke is resolved. No one agrees with Stanitsas, and you'll
            find that Iakovos (Nafpliotis) and Priggos are quite similar (this was demonstrated
            by Dimitrios' comparisons). What I'm about to describe is none of all this, regardless
            of my admiration for Iakovos.<br>
            <br>
            The following is my "Synthesis" after having heard Parallagi [VERY IMPORTANT] on
            bits and pieces of Barys by the Protocanonarchos [student of Iakovos, Binakis AND
            Kamarados], as well as my grand (meaning "great") uncle Nicolaos Xirodimas (his
            son, now in his late 60's, would sing with Beloussis at Ag. Panteleimon Acharnon).<br>
            <br>
            By Epitropi vs. Chrysanthos, I was referring to MY visual conception of the scale.
            Ioannis (Arvanitis) and Panayiotis (Papadimitriou) have now demonstrated the SIMILARITIES
            of the two scales REGARDLESS of the visual and numeric differences which describe
            the SAME FREQUENCIES in DIFFERENT manner. Anyhow, I insist that the Chrysanthos
            diagram helps me do CORRECT intervals in terms of its "psychological effect", which
            is "different" from that of the "epitropi".....The Chrysanthos diagram helps me
            do almost "Didymos" intervals, as Panayiotis (Papadimitriou) demonstrated. The Epitropi
            diagram, on the other hand, tends to push me into doing "piano" intervals...<br>

        <span class='name'>On Barys Diatonikos vs. Legetos (part II):<br>
            <br>
        </span>
        <div class="text">
            I just came off the line with Andrea. She really enjoyed the Barys by Proussaslis
            (especially his hyphos = like Iakovos) and Sfikas (for the clarity of the intervals).
            She mentioned a "high Ga towards Di", so I guess we're in the theory I was mentioning.
            SOME intervals may sound like those of Legetos, but Barys is NOT EXACTLY legetos,
            she insisted. She just discovered Feihrouz singing legatos (in some folk song) and
            was astounded with the INTERVAL precision as well as difference as to most Greek
            psaltis, and said that Karas' description is not too bad. Ibrahim does the same
            intervals. And I recall that Bardas and I had some trouble "tuning into each other's
            legetos after many years of separation. Bardas does, most of the time, those particular
            intervals of legetos that Faihrouz and Ibrahim do.<br>
            <br>
            Bou = ison. Di is QUITE HIGH, and Ke seems to be lowered, and ZO is DIATONIC and
            quite high (at all times, no Zo hyphesis). In the lower part, Pa is close to Bou
            (because it is naturally high", yet NI is slightly "uplifted" = does not sound in
            its plagal fourth position, when we transiently go past it. Zo is STABLE in ascent
            AND descent, with NO hyphesis. You can hear all this in Bardas' chanting of "Anoixo
            to stoma mou" or in "Ek neotitos mou" under "kyr Bardas" in Montral Psaltiki in
            www.graeca.mrezha.net/upload/<br>
            <br>
            Somewhere along the line we all "mess him up", because we all have OTHER legetos
            in our heads... but there are parts where he applies those exact intervals (especially
            in the very beginning of each hymn). I admit that those intervals sound a bit "funny"            as compared to those of Tsolakidis, and we do not have much of legetos by Iakovos
            for comparison. We know, however, that his plagal fourth Di is a bit higher as compared
            to a First mode Di (listen to Mi apostrepsis"). So, this INTERVAL stability in legetos,
            with a HIGH di and a slightly lowered Ke seems to have pleased Andrea enormously,
            for she "rediscovers" legetos.... in a manner that corresponds well to the descriptions
            given by Karas.....<br>
            <br>
            Use of "syneptigmenos" in OTHER languages: As for rhythmos, in Greek we tend to
            prolong the accentuated syllable a bit more than the non accentuated syllable in
            Heirmologic chanting. In Andrea's native language, Hungarian, it seems that accentuated
            syllables should NOT be prolonged, and that iambic type of distribution may be better
            suited than trochaios in "thesis to thesis" counting.<br>
            <br>
            About Barys diatonic [Sfikas]: Andrea said that the Sfikas intervals are those she
            had learnt from Angelopoulos... now, if anyone has EBX chanting Barys diatonikos,
            I'd like to verify the connection between theory and practice.. She'll have to listen
            to all this much more carefully so as to come up with some "interval diagram", because
            all this was discussed over the phone...<br>
            <br>
            Since Dimitrios mentioned a "high Ga" and so did she, I thought I'd share all this
            with you. I personally hear Pa-bou-Ga-di ALL downshifted.... this doesn't really
            make Ga sharp... We had come up with that diagram together, but she'd like to rehear
            things and come up with something more concrete.... To my ears, the Pa-bou-Ga-di
            ALL downshifted scale describes very well all that is happening in Barys diatonikos
            "special intervals" and explains what happens when ison is brought to normal diatonic
            Pa so as to make "protobarys".<br>

        <div class="text">
            From memory, Chatzimarkos does a very nice "Barys diatonikos" in the Psalmos 50
            with "Anastas of Ihsous" as well... I hope someone can find this recording of his...
            the situation is similar: The ison remains on Zo diatonic. The Heptophonic Zo becomes
            ENARMONIC, with Ano Ni and Ano Pa lowered a bit ("special interval" as applied to
            the octave). Coming back down, the Di is in HYPHESIS, and the Ga is Lower than diatonic,
            the Bou lower than diatonic, the Pa lower than diatonic, the Ni more or les in its
            position, Zo diatonic in its position...("special intervals"). Listen to the line
            "Eis mnimosinon aiOOOOOOOOOOOnion estai dikaios, Alliluia".<br>

        L. Asteris, Protopsaltis of the Great Church (2005) [<a             href="http://www.cmkon.net/music/Heruv_Varis_LA.rm">rm,</a> 1.9 Mb]<br>
        <br>
        <div class="text">
            In the line "oi ta cherouBEIIIIIIIM", in its ending melodic formula, we hear the
            "special intervals". During the Orthros, all of the recorded psaltis do a NICE Ga
            DI (LARGE) in the Enarmonios pieces that precede this hymn, yet the ALL mess up
            the KE (TOO low for enarmonios).<br>
            <br>
            According to Andrea (Atlanti): Karas is perhaps correct about Naos but quite correct
            about Barys being almost equal to legetos at lower "basis". According to me and
            from what I've understood from Chatzitheodoros, the use of put second mode fthora
            is for "approximation" purposes... and I tend to agree much more with him... and
            I add, Barys is NOT legetos from a lower Basis. Andrea admits that she's never heard
            the "special intervals" as I do them THROUGHOUT a papadic melos, yet she DOES agree
            that those are the VERY intervals when I sing something like "eleison me o Theos"            = Psalm 50...<br>
            <br>
            My opinion is that we have "remnants" of the special intervals in various places,
            and that, because it is quite hard to do them throughout a piece, most will chant
            papadic barys diatonikos as they would a legetos, or as second mode or even as a
            first mode. It's true that in "ton despotin", = where the entry of the archieureus
            " = represents the entry of Christ into his "ship" which is the Church = where the
            archieureus should be "taking kairos" immediately, but I guess this has been broken
            into two: eis polla eti for the entry, and "ton despotin" for kairos ... "anothen"            for the amphia vesting", Iakovos chants the "deuteros variant" (his Zo Ke Di is
            almost like Di Ga Bou of second mode), with non chromatic Pa = Ke (His pa is NOT
            lowered at all)... But I've heard the remnant "special intervals" in Tsolakidis'
            chantng. Thus far, only Ioannis has ventured a bit on all my Barys diatonikos descriptions,
            and I have yet to hear any serious debate on these descriptions of what happens
            at the lower pentachord (pa, bou Ga, Di, ALL shifted a bit lower...) .<br>

            Return to Chrysanthos BOY. Return to Chrysanthos Pa. Go to Bou, but slightly diminished.
            return to PA, but slightly diminished, as if you were doing an Epitropi Pa (Lower
            than First mode diatonic Chrysanthos Pa). Bring Ni bit close to this Pa. then do
            a Chrysanthos Zo. Thus how, PA-Bou isn't really diminished: It's just that the whole
            Di Ga BOU PA is "brought down in a particular way. So, this is what I think Chatzitheodoros
            means, when he says that the Fthora of 2nd mode is there because barys diatonickos
            "sounds a bit like second mode", without it being so. In the meantime, the lowered
            Ga is not as much lowered as the Pa, and Bou Ga might seem slightly greater than
            usual. Perhaps this explains Ephesios' use of the second mode fthora on Pa on short
            passages, so that one will not lower the Ga disproportionately. None of the all
            the teachers I did parallagi called the Zo by any other name, fthora or no fthora.
            That's interesting. My guess is that, with time, some probably started putting PA
            as an isson instead of ZO. In such a case, we cannot continue with a lowered pa,
            and the whole thing turns into a "first mode" Pa, and it's only the Di, all alone,
            that is lowered, giving a "pathitikos" instead of "barys special intervals".<br>
            <br>
            I'm sending you a sample of these two compositions, where I try to respect, at least
            to a minimum, the use of the fthoras, which, of course, have nothing to do with
            second mode. (Back then, I did various interpretations of "Ton Despotin" either
            alternating of the fthores so as to get "special" vs "diatonic" or disregarding
            them and doing "special" throughout. The paleographers noted that there is NO fthora
            in the original manuscripts.... On the other hand, I send you as well a "home choir
            recording" I put together a couple of months ago (it' only lately that I'm beginning
            to recover a bit of my voice. So, I'm like an old, badly tuned violin, especially
            in TEMPO. anyhow, the idea here is that I did NOT try to go into first mode. I kept
            Zo as isson throughout.

            Now, I guess things start to become clearer. If you keep isson a Zo, you can pull
            your Pa a bit down, and you can do this THROUGHOUT the piece, fthora or no fthora

            I thank Dimitrios for putting up the barys diatonikos file. Here is some IMPORTANT
            information concerning the file. Composition: it is MY won. I try to show what Rhythmic
            emphasis is, and how toobtain some COMPOSITIONAL Rhythmic regularity.<br>
            <br>
            Interpretations are of 3 "types". Protobarys, Spatheion and Barys Diatonikos. The
            experiment was as follows: Using the SAME score, to try and determine if there are
            any DIFFERENCES or similarities. Firstly, the COMPOSITION is almost INCOMPATIBLE
            with protobarys. In Protobarys, we chant FIRST mode hiermologic, with Pa Di as dominant
            notes (and not Pa Ga, as in this case). Anyhow, I just wanted to try and demonstrate
            the difference between Ga-DI spatheion, first mode, and "special intervals". For
            Protobarys, I used an ison on PA... For Spatheion, ison on Pa as well. For Barys
            diatonikos, ison on Zo.

            As a matter of fact, I did use ison in one ear, but it is not in the recording.
            when I do interval experiments, the ISON must be there, as it is in Church, otherwise
            things aren't that "comparable". I used Occidental notes, so the Zo-Pa isn't exactly
            psaltic... Isson allows one to find the CORRECT harmonics (chord fractions that
            will give the LEAST dissonance... Thus how, when isson is on Ni, Di is a bit higher
            so as to get a good fifth. When isson is Pa, Di is a bit lower, and the Fifth is
            Ke. Thus, for a SAME PA, DI is DIFFERENT depending on whether we're in first mode
            of plagal first mode... The same applies to BARYS with isson on Zo... placing an
            isson on Pa will change MANY intervals.. ..Anyhow..<br>

        <br>
        <div class="text">
            For the first two cases [Protobarys and Spatheion], Ke should be HIGH (although
            I do mess it up a bit on the spatheion... it needs to be a bit higher, toward the
            Zo hyphesis). Pa is in its isson position. Zo is in its diatonic position. This
            Zo sounds higher than the Barys diatonic Zo.... Andrea insists that it shouldn't
            be, even in first mode.

            In Protobarys, the Basis is mainly Pa... so is the basis = Pa in Kyrie ekekraxa
            and, recall, I DON'T change the ison from Pa to Zo in the "eisakouson mOUOUOUOU"....

            In first mode kekragarion ending on Zo, arabs chant this a bit lower, Greeks a bit

            I don't understand what is an "occidental Zo" and what it means to "treat it "elxeis"".
            There is no such thing as elxis on the base note of the mode.

            Occidental Zo is a bit higher for an equal Pa...<br>
            <br>
            I'm dealing with FIRST MODE with ison on PA... I repeat, I'm dealing with FIRST

            In any case why are you doing Protobarys as a Greek and Barys as an Arab?? :)

            <span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis:</span><br>
            I don't know, Dimitris. the whole thing is an experiment. I've noticed that there
            are two different Zos from time to time. Spontaneously, I do a higher Zo in
            <br>
            first mode vs. Barys. What I'm trying to figure out is... is it all right or is
            it not? To answer my question, try doing ison on Pa continuously. If it sounds "ackward",
            maybe I should be doing a lower Zo. After some thought and listening to Iakovos
            and Dositheos, I realize that psaltic Zo in fist mode should be LOW. So, my "occidental"            Zo in Fisrt mode is an error.....<br>
            <br>
            In Barys diatonikos, I try to do the Special intervals. We should try figuring out
            if the PA I do here is in the same position as the PA in protobarys and spatheion.

            About Barys diatonikos: I haven't paid attention to PA yet, from a first listen
            it sounds the same throughout, I will listen more carefully. For the moment let's
            <br>
            concentrate on what you do to ZW and GA. Basically you do what I observed and reported
            but well, you cheat! Instead of keeping ZW
            <br>
            the same in all branches of Barys and lowering or raising GA accordingly (to 8 or
            12 moria in terms of the BOY-GA interval), you keep GA the
            <br>
            same and you move (in particular you lower) ZW so that the ZW-GA interval sounds
            like a perfect fifth (to satisfy Psaxos' argument).<br>
            <br>
            <span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis:</span><br>
            Notice that the Ni Zo is quite "large", and that Zo is quite "low", just like a
            GA BOY in legetos.<br>
            <br>
            <span class='name'>D. Koubaroulis:</span><br>
            Yes...only that you lower it too much in my opinion. It sounds almost enharmonic.
            By the way, the PA-NH-ZW = DI-GA-BOY analogy is
            <br>
            correct and it is witnessed by theoreticians of the old method as well (B. Stephanides,
            1819 is an example). Panagiotidis agrees as well.
            <br>
            Stanitsas disagrees in his interview, who knows why.. maybe because he doesn' t
            like Karas.<br>
            <br>
            <span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis:</span><br>
            For Andrea = Di Ga bou, and Tsolakidis does a nice large Ga bou in legetos, so I
            guess the ENDING(lower zone) might sound like legetos, but certainly not the upper
            zone... Do I "cheat" in Eleison me o theos as well??? THAT's the real standard,
            for me (something I learned well by heart)..<br>
            <br>
            <span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis:</span><br>
            Finally, the Eleison me O Theos is done by heart, and is my "interval reference"            for Barys diatonikos.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class='name'>D. Koubaroulis:</span><br>
            It sounds good, better than the other examples.<br>
            <br>
            <span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis:</span><br>
            Aha... It's because I'm really not thinking, and just applying everything I've learned..<br>
            <br>
            <span class='name'>D. Koubaroulis:</span><br>
            I think this is because in fast chants you don't get to spend too much time on controversial
            intervals and they don't stick out that much. Not saying that the
            <br>
            other recordings are bad, but I think they have issues.<br>
            <br>
            <span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis:</span><br>
            You're absolutely correct...<br>
            <br>
            <span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis:</span><br>
            Try and figure out if I do a "down shifted" "pa-Bou-Ga-Di", in which case the Ga-Pa
            is not the same as the Ga-Pa of Spatheion (= Bestengar, according to me). If you
            find no differences, then we may say that even thinking differently and putting
            the isson in different postions doesn't change much.<br>
            <br>
            <span class='name'>D. Koubaroulis:</span><br>
            Although I haven't paid attention to PA, it seems to me logical to
            <br>
            lower PA and BOY since you have lowered ZW in the first place. So your issue is
            ZW and not lowering PA and BOY.<br>
            <br>
            <span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis:</span><br>
            MMMM... let's take the one we agree on, eleison me O Theos.. does the Ni PA sound
            like that of first mode. Are MOST of the notes in the SAME position as first mode,
            or are they slightly lower. In this piece, I honestly don't feel that it is only
            Zo that is "quite low"... Focus in on the PA and try telling me what happens, please.<br>
            <br>
            <span class='name'>D. Koubaroulis:</span><br>
            I am not sure about that yet.<br>
            <br>
            <span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis:</span><br>
            I feel that barys diatonikos has "special" intervals and that it is not exactly
            spatheion melody.<br>
            <br>
            <span class='name'>D. Koubaroulis:</span><br>
            Nobody said it is spatheion.

            <span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis:</span><br>
            The instrumental recordings You put up sound quite spatheion to me... we may wish
            to push up bou a bit, but all in all, they are "first mode pathitikos", which eventually
            drop to Zo. This means that EVERYTHING is equal to first mode except Di ,and perhaps
            the Bou. I'm just describing what I heard.<br>
            <br>
            <span class='name'>D. Koubaroulis:</span><br>
            Gregorios' doxology is indicated by a 4up sign (therefore Tetraphonos) and has DI
            flat (what does this flat mean?). If you consider that the same as First
            <br>
            mode Diphonos (what you call spatheion) then we hear different things or Stanitsas
            is wrong in his interpretation of GA-DI in the IBM recording.<br>
            <br>
            <span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis:</span><br>
            NO... I'm trying to prove the OPPOSITE: I'm trying to prove that the BARYS diatonikos
            has NOTHING to do with the instrumental version you've put up which are CLOSER to first mode pathitikos.
            I'm trying to prove that the for a SAME ZO, the PA is NOT the same between Spatheion
            = first and Barys diatonikos. But since instruments cannot distinguish between the
            two, they play the SAME pa.
            <p/>
            And I'm trying to demonstrate that what I chant in "eleison me" was not learnt from
            some instrument, and that names such as Betang.. have NOTHING to do with what one
            can learn form a teacher's mouth. What do Stanitsas' intervals have to do with the
            two other superb interval interpretations you put up???? NOTHING!!!
            <p/>
            All in all: I feel that one should distinguish between Protobarys, Spatheion (Pathitikos)
            and special intervals. The latter are possible ONLY if one maintains isson on ZO
            throughout the piece. Draw a diagram according to Chrysanthos. Take DI, Ga, Bou
            PA and push them all down about 2 or 3units (out of 12/68). Push Ga just a bit up
            (one or two units = ALMOST its initial position). Push Ni JUST a bit up (one or
            two units). These are the SPECIAL intervals. The fthora of Di on Pa can be explained
            by a large BOU GA interval, which sounds SHARP, thus satisfying Ephesios&#8217;            writings. Ni Zo is large, even without moving the Ni, if one uses the Chrysanthos
            diagram, and it thus sounds like Legetos, satisfying the Legetos theory. Ga Di is
            small, satisfying the hyphesis on Di theories. Yet, this scale is NEITHER protobarys
            NOR spatheion.
