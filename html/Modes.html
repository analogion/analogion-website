        A live, ever growing, on-line theory book where you can actually listen to the theoretical
        explanations given or -as you prefer- read the theoretical explanations of what
        is heard. For instance, say you are reading about First mode and you are looking
        at its apechema. Next to it, there is one (or more) sound link with example(s).
        Then talking about katalikseis, again, sound examples of katalikseis. Then talking
        about elxeis (melodic attractions), same thing. Not a primer/tutorial, the aim is
        to go into details with time. My initial plan is to include information about the
        BM modes and chroai. For the theoretical content I am going to use various sources
        as I see necessary. Where there are different views, I will mention them. The content
        will be always up for discussion/correction and, as always, enjoyment.
