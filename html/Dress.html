    (<a href="http://www.ec-patr.org/docdisplay.php?lang=gr&amp;id=379&amp;tla=gr%29">http://www.ec-patr.org/docdisplay.php?lang=gr&amp;id=379&amp;tla=gr)</a><br>
    Patriarch Bartholomeos mentioned the following interesting things<br>
    about the dress of the psaltai. In my own translation:<br>
    <br>
    "Unfortunately, we see -with reasonable concern and sadness-, some<br>
    chanters dressing up in unusual gowns with deep purple or red colars<br>
    around the neck and wrists, some also with gold-woven artwork which<br>
    manifest a secular spirit, spiritual emptiness and make the chanter a<br>
    miserable view to see."<br>
    <br>
    Before that, he mentions that the psaltic dress should be all black<br>
    and nothing else. Now we all know that in Byzantium psaltai used to<br>
    dress much more fancy than that. Comments?<br>
    <br>
    He also says that the Archon Protopsaltis (the right chanter of the<br>
    Patriarchate) wears a black cap that symbolises his wisdom and virtue.<br>
    Does the same apply to all the other protopsaltai that have been named<br>
    "Archon of the Arhdiocese of Constantinople" or do they breach the<br>
    protocol? What about the Archon Lambadarios? He does wear a cap as<br>
    well. The Patriarch probably included all the above under the term<br>
    "Archon Protopsaltis". Correct if wrong.
