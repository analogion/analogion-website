    <div class="question">
        What about "Anothen oi Profitai..." chanted while the Bishop gets vested?</div>
    <!--<div class="answer">
        <span class="name">Y. Bilalis</span>: While the Bishop is getting vested at the
        Throne with the 2 deacons reading the prayers and delivering the vestments, the
        choir of cantors (one note from manuscript has the left choir to perform it; the
        modern practice has the right choir, which is usually the most skillful) chants
        the hymn "Anothen oi Prophetai"=&gt; The Prophets from on high have declared you,
        O maiden (=Theotokos), a pitcher (Exodus 16: 13-34), a rod (Num. 17: 16-24), a slab
        (Dan. 2: 28-35), a table, a lamp, a box/case, a bridge and scale (Gen. 28: 12),
        a non-carved mountain (Dan. 2: 35), a golden censer, a palace and throne of the
        King; the composition usually include "terirem" and reeat the last pohrase of the
        text again to end. From my small research I have not found in the past this hymn
        as a part of a specific service, but certain scattered Theotokia have these addresses
        for the Theotokos. All the above are taken from the Old Testament, I gave you the
        references. From a musicological standpoint, Ioannes Koukouzelis had composed first
        this hymn in two modes: 1. mode barys which was transcribed and published by the
        Three teachers (1814) in the new musical method as well as an abridged form which
        is most likely known and practised by the modern Greek cantors (one recent recording
        is done by Maistores choir conducted by Greg. Stathis); 2. mode plagal of second
        (nenano), which was until recently unpublished and unknown to the Greek musical
        library (Xourmouzios has transcribed it in his Matins #704 MPT manuscript of the
        Greek National Library) and was recorded by the Greek Byzantine Choir under Lyk.
        Angelopoulos (nice performance). There is also a hagiographic (painting) theme with
        the title "Anothen oi prophetai" which was analyzed in detail by one modern archaelogy
        scholar (if you need further details I will provide you the name and publication,
        it is in Greek though). Further, Petros Bereketis (17th c.) is composing anew another
        hymn for the Bishop's vesting procedure "Se megalunomen tin ontos Theotokon" (the
        text still refers to the Theotokos with many "Rejoice" to Her) in mode fourth (hagia);        Gregorios Protopsaltis (19th c.), one of the Three Teachers of the chrysanthine
        reform, is composing a different text in mode barys than his predecessors: "Perizosai
        tin romfaian sou", which is one of the prayers that the Bishop/Priest are saying
        when they are vesting on the "ypogonation" (I do not know the English equivalent),
        it was performed by the Thessalonian Choir (100 members that night) directed by
        Karamanis/Chrysanthos/Taliadoros (june 12, 1971) in Herodeion theatre, Athens, Greece.
        Last, Basileios Nikolaides of Zagliveri (in the Greek Macedonia part, 19th c.) is
        composing in first mode another text ("Rabdon dunameos exapostelei soi kurios o
        Theos), which is used as a prayer when the Bishop is taking his Rabdos/Rod from
        his deacons. It seems that the last two hymns/compositions are more relevant to
        the vesting procedure. The byzantine tradition though used a hymn which was devoted
        to the Theotokos although the Bishop is the icon of Christ. I do not know why. Something
        to clarify here for the non-Greek orthodox fellows. The chanting of the above 4
        different compositions is done at the same time while the two deacons are intoning
        (I do not know if this is the correct word) semi-loudly the prayers for each article
        of the whole vesting procedure. Prior to that vesting procedure, and immediately
        after the "Praise him all ye his angels" of the Praises /Matins (Left choir is chanting
        that) we do not continue to the Stichera, but we stop and the Bishop "pairnei kairo"(=
        take time to pray). While this is done the Right Choir of cantors are chanting "Ton
        despotin kai arxierea imon Kurie fulatte", an ancient melody composed anonymously
        in mode barys, a very artistic composition which has arisen a controversy among
        the modern Greek cantors as far as the execution of a specific interval. The melody
        is papadic in order to give time to the Bishop to pray and move and venerate the
        4 main icons of the Templo (Iconostasis). Unfortunately, 2-3 years ago I have read
        a bad critique from a fellow musician from St. Vladimiros Institute ( I do not recall
        name) published in a California journal (??orthodox psalm), who was criticizing
        the slugginess of the Greek version messing up with the other 'Ton despotin kai
        arxierea" that we sing at the dismissal of the services!!!!! Anyhow, after this
        process is finished we continue the stichera of the Praises, Glory (Right cantors),
        both now (Left cantors; except the Typikon is asking for Glory/Both now ---&gt;        then it is performed by the Right cantors) and here again we stop and the Deacon
        is announcing "Kelefson, kelefsate, Iereis exelthete" and the clergy is coming out
        in the solea for the vesting procedure of the presiding Bishop. Another observation
        to give to the fellow readers of "Typikon" list: I have noticed that during the
        commemoration of St. Athanasios Athonitis, the protector of Great Lavra, Mount Athos
        on July 5 (O.C) 1982, Danielaioi-Thomades chanted the "Another oi prophetai" at
        the Narthex in front of the icon of Theotokos and the Bishop was vested in the Narthex.
        as far as your second paragraph: it is correct that the Bishop in the greek tradition
        finishes the proskomidi during the cherubic hymn and that was the need to compose
        longer Cherubic Hymns and give time to the clergy to finish. Unfortunately, I have
        seen lately the bishops of GOA to cut-off the proskomidi time in order to finish
        quickly(.....) the service. I totally agree with your Byzantine catholic friend,
        BUT we (clergy/cantors) must educate our people why it takes so much time every
        Sunday, especially the greek-americans ....

    <div class="answer">
        <span class="name">Shota Gugushvili</span>: OK, so here's a quote from Elder Xrysostomos'
        book "Holy Mountain Typikon of Church Services": After the apolysis of the 6th Hour
        two deacons with dikiry and trikiry leave the vima and stand near the bishop, who
        descends from the throne, makes ekfonisis "Eulogitos o Theos imon..." and starts
        the entrance prayers, while the right choir is chanting slow "Ton despotin..." in
        Varys. After the completion of the prayers the bishop blesses people with dikiry
        and trikiry* and the deacons in turns exclaim "Iereis exelthete", "Exelthete iereis"        until all priests leave the vima, each with some part of the bishop's vestments.
        The bishop stands under the great polykandilion and the deacons between two candleholders,
        facing the bishop, exclaiming "Tou Kyriou deithomen. Kyrie eleison" and the verses
        on vesting the bishop "Agalliasetai i psixi mou..." and others, while the priests
        are vesting the bishop. During the bishop's vesting the left choir is chanting slow
        "Anothen oi profitai..." of St. Ioannis Koukouzelis. When the bishop, vested, blesses
        the people with trikiry and dikiry, the right choir, interrupting the left, chants
        "Eis polla eti, despota". Then the bishop stands in the middle of the temple** facing
        the vima. The priests come to him from both sides and ask forgiveness and blessing***.
        <p>
            * In many monasteries, the left choir, interrupting the right one, chants quickly
            "Eis polla eti, despota". Elder Xrysostomos notes that this is not entirely correct
            since these words are contained in slow "Ton despotin...".
            <br>
            ** If a bishop is old, a seat is brought to him.
            <br>
            *** A different, shorter rule, found in the Greek Arxieratikon (the one which Yorgos
            described) is also described. It is performed if time for some reason is limited.
            Thus the difference is that the bishop vests after the 3rd and 6th Hours. If one
            is interested in the historical practice of the Great Church, then one must consult
            Dmitrievskiy's "Opisanie...", see <a href="http://www.liturgy.ru/newpdf/d3_201-400.pdf">
                pdf</a>, p. 101(301). The rule given there (in Greek) is from the 14th c. ms
            from St. Savvas' monastery.
