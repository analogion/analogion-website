    <div class="question">
        �Why are they notated as hard chromatic with a basis of PA (or BOY) isntead of DI in classical scores?</div>
        
    <div class="answer">
        The commonly accepted answer is that the hard chromatic fthora means that the melody will progress in the fashion of a Plagal mode and the pitch of the basis has to be picked lower than usual to account for the extended vocal range utilised by such pieces. This explanation was first given by Simon Karas in his theory book. 
        <p/>Angelos Boudouris disagrees as to the selection of the basis pitch. In his theory book, he states that the pitch of the basis should be taken high, to indicate an authentic ("kyrios") mode rather than a plagal.
