    <div style="text-align: justify;">
        There are some occasions where pieces of First (Diatonic) mode are chanted
        in Second (Soft Chromatic) mode. Other times, certain passages or melodic
        phrases of First mode, moving mainly around its basis sound like Second mode. What
        are those pieces/passages? Why does that happen?

    <br>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
        1. The kathisma/prosomoion "Ton Tafon sou Soter" belongs to First mode but is notated
        as belonging to Second mode and has a "sound" (&#940;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#956;&#945;)
        of Second mode. See relevant page on the analogion [<a href="TonTafonSouSoter.html">html</a>].        <br>
        <br>
        2. The classical slow Alleluiarion of the Apostolos (by Ioannis Protopsaltis) which
        is commonly chanted at the Patriarchate is indicated as First mode but is chanted
        in Second mode for most of its duration (with the placement of a chromatic fthora).
        <br>
        <br>
        3. The same happens with the idiomelo "En tais Lambrotesi ton Agion Sou" of Great
        Tuesday (in Holy Week).
        <br>
        <br>
        4. The beginning of certain papadic compositions of First mode sounds like
        Second mode. E.g. listen to the beginning of the Koinonikon "Aineite" as chanted
        by S. Tsolakidis [<a href="../wma/Tsol60_Koinonikon__Mode_01_Sparti_AgiosSpyridon03.wma">wma</a>,        346 Kb] .<br>
        <br>
        Are there more examples?<br>

    <div style="text-align: justify;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">D. Koubaroulis. </span>Assuming PA is the basis
        of First mode, the two intervals below it are <span style="font-weight: bold;">PA 12
            NH 8 ZW</span> exactly as in <span style="font-weight: bold;">DI 12 GA 8 BOY</span>
        of Second soft Chromatic. The intervals above PA are <span style="font-weight: bold;">
            PA 10 BOY 8 GA</span> (18 moria) compared to <span style="font-weight: bold;">DI 8 KE
                14 ZW</span> (22 moria) of Second mode. So, when the melody doesn't show
        too much GA and stays between the ZW-BOY tetrachord then the intervals are almost
        identical to Second Soft Chromatic mode. I don't know how to explain "Ton Tafon
        Sou" and I am not even sure about the above explanation but I haven't come across
        any better one so far. So I am making this page in the hope that someone will
        <a href="mailto:dimitri@analogion.com">submit a better answer</a>.        <br>
        <br>
        The following are my assumptions, not checked for correctness. In some theoretical
        treatises of the old method of Byzantine chant (like this one Ms Dionysiou [<a href="../zip/TreatiseOnTonesAndModes-MsDionysiou.zip">zip</a>]        on the analogion) we read the following " if you move up three tones you shall
        find First mode and this is the Second mode, because the First is one and the same
        with the Second". If that refers to the base pitches of the notes then it says that
        the base note of First mode is the same as the base note of the Second mode. In
        modern terms, if KE is the base note of the First mode (as it is in some old compositions)
        then KE should be the base note of the Second mode too. That would explain the placement
        of Second mode on KE by Propsaltis Georgios Raidestinos and it would explain the
        conversion of First to Second on the same note in "Ton Tafon sou" and the other
        pieces mentioned above. Just a thought.
