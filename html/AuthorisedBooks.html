        Question:</h4>
    What does it mean that a book is "authorised by tradition"?<br>

        By 'authorized' I mean the books containing the transcriptions of the<br>
        Three Teachers or the books that immediately followed them, ie. the<br>
        Heirmologion, Anastasimatarion, Doxastarion by Petros Lampadarios<br>
        transcribed directly from the Old Notation, the Mousike Pandekte by Ioannis<br>
        Lampadarios and Stephanos Domestikos or the Tameion Anthologias (first<br>
        edition by Hourmouzios, another edition by Gregorios) containing the<br>
        transcriptions of these Teachers directly from the Old Notation. The small<br>
        changes in the performance of these chants in the Patriarchate produced the<br>
        Anastasimatarion and Heirmologion by Ioannis Protopsaltis and the Mousike<br>
        Kypsele by Stephanos, including the older chants in a very slightly<br>
        rearranged or slightly embellished form. All these books had been given the<br>
        patriarchal seal and were 'authorized', although by 'authorized' I meant<br>
        mainly 'authorized by tradition', in the sense that they transferred exactly<br>
        the older tradition or its slightly embellished form which continued to<br>
        carry the same spirit and included practically the same chants. In this<br>
        sense, also books published by Theodoros Phokaeus or others, including also<br>
        some compositions of their own, retain the same spirit and are 'authorized<br>
        by tradition'. In some period, the Patriarchate had really a committee for<br>
        chequing the musical books and giving or not its authorization. So, the<br>
        books by Nikolaos Smyrnis were not 'authorized'. This committe did not<br>
        continue to exist, so in our century almost every book with every fanciful<br>
        melody inside has a patriarchal official letter as 'authorization'. Books<br>
        including melodies in secular style, of inferior quality, like oriental<br>
        dances etc. etc. are supposed to represent or continue the tradition of the<br>
        Patriarchate because these patriarchal letters were sent indiscriminately<br>
        almost to evryone. So, Nikolaos Smyrnis seems extremely traditional when<br>
        compared with some of the subsequent composers. Sorry for the lovers eg. of<br>
        Taliadoros, but his books, as well as books by Pettas, Fortomas, Ioannidis<br>
        and others include a highly deteriorated 'Byz. Music' which nevertheless<br>
        seems to have the patriarchal approval. (For those possessing their Liturgy<br>
        books, see eg. the 'Chorodiakon Cherouvikon' in PL.4 and a ''Se ymnoumen''<br>
        in 3rd by Taliadoros, a Kratema in 1st mode by Pettas etc. I don't think<br>
        that this is serious BYz. church music anymore). I must confess that I'm not<br>
        very fond of committees or the like, as they can supress even serious<br>
        attemts to compose new chants , in a frame of a sterile sense of tradition,<br>
        but no one has seriously and objectively criticized these books and<br>
        compositions and, if someone does, he will be regarded as an enemy of the<br>
        Patiarchate and og tradition! I'm not afraid of saying this, trying at the<br>
        same time and nevertheless to keep in my mind that these people, despite<br>
        their deficiencies, have contributed to keep this tradition alive. Karamanis<br>
        eg. contributed with his books to keep the analysis of the musical signs<br>
        alive and has taught thousands of people. Taladoros is standing and singing<br>
        in the Church for over fifty years and has had a lot of pupils. But at the<br>
        same time, their books and the analytic way the write the melodies<br>
        contributed to a change of taste and to almost a complete rejecting of the<br>
        classic books (the ones mentioned above) by a vast majority of psaltai. The<br>
        result was that these psaltai don't have anymore a firm basis to form<br>
        criteria about the traditional and appropriate music for the church,<br>
        something able to be formed, according to me, only by studying the older<br>
        chants from their original versions. And in connection to the fact that<br>
        these aforementioned psaltai (as well as psaltai of the Patriarchate like<br>
        Pringos or Stanitsas or other psaltai from Constantinople) used to go to<br>
        ''panygeria'' (feast days of various churches) and sing mainly in an<br>
        improvisational manner, the result was that many psaltai, in an attempt to<br>
        imitate them and gain some of their 'glory', consider it better and more<br>
        technical to improvise and reject the books almost altogether. This also<br>
        comes from a mistalen interpretation of a patriarchal encyclical, obliging<br>
        psaltai to learn the chants by heart. But the patriarchal encyclical<br>
        referred to specific old melodies to be learned by heart, not to<br>
        improvisation and singing as one wishes. So, for many psaltai books hold an<br>
        inferior position in their psaltic activities and a question about<br>
        'authorized' books has maybe no meaning.<br>

            Questions:</h4>
        <i>My priest has loaned me his Anastasimatarion, published by Zoe in<br>
            1981,and his 8-volume Mousike Pandekte set, published by Zoe in 1984.<br>
            (I believe he obtained these while he was at Holy Cross Seminary,<br>
            Brookline (near Boston), USA.)</i><br>
        <h4>
            Answers by I. Arvanitis:</h4>
        The Anastasimatarion by Ioannis is OK and is the basic book we also<br>
        start teaching. The 'Mousikos Pandektis' by Zoe is not the ideal thing. To<br>
        be specific: the volumes for Vespers, Matins and Liturgy contain mainly<br>
        classical chants and are OK in this respect. But for anyone whishing to go a<br>
        little further they are very little. These were the almost only extant books<br>
        when I started to learn Byz. Chant in my 14's. I wanted to learn more and so<br>
        was obliged to copy chants by hand from older books which were not easily<br>
        found and were not easily given by their owners. On the other hand, in these<br>
        books the Kratemata (terirem) are completely rejected. The 3rd volume<br>
        (Heirmologion) includes the Katavasiai by Petros Lampadarios (in Ioannis<br>
        Protopsaltis's slightly changed version), but rearranged at some points<br>
        according to a false opinion about the division of the text in phrases, the<br>
        treatment of grammatical accents the flow of the melody etc. According to<br>
        the same false opinions, the short heirmoi of the Kanones have been<br>
        rearranged. They are maybe not awful but they are not what they should be<br>
        (it would take me a lot of time to explain these things). But the main<br>
        'destruction', I could say, has happened in this series by the more<br>
        extensive application of these false opinions in the Vols 5-8. Traditional<br>
        formulas are cut, shortened and changed to serve, as these people believed,<br>
        the better delivery of the text, its sense and its flow. But in the vast<br>
        majority of the cases, they make exactly the opposite. So, while in the<br>
        classical books the chants flow and there is a 'symmetry' between successive<br>
        phrases and periods, this flow is destroyed in Zoe's books. One must of<br>
        course not only know but also 'feel' the Greek language and feel the<br>
        symmetry to appreciate my statement (it seems that these Greeks had not this<br>
        feeling). For those who maybe cannot yet, I offer here my opinion and<br>
        knowledge about these matters, coming from research in chants and their way<br>
        of composition of all the periods, as a secure, as I believe, point to<br>
        start.<br>
        <br>
        <i>Are the earlier books, the ones you prefer, available today (for<br>
            example, as reprints)? Would this list be right?<br>
            The Heirmologion, Anastasimatarion, Doxastarion by Petros<br>
            Lampadarios?</i><br>
        <br>
        Yes. The Heirmologion by Petros is accompanied by the Short (syntomon)<br>
        Heirmologion by Petros Vyzantios. Instead of both, you can use the<br>
        Heirmologion by Ioannis Protopsaltis. It's more practical and is
        <br>
        the basic version we sing and teach.<br>
        <br>
        <i>The Mousike Pandekte by Ioannis Lampadarios
            <br>
            and Stephanos Domestikos?</i><br>
        <br>
        Yes. Four bulky volumes. It is in fact the Anthologia compiled by<br>
        Gregorios Protopsaltis containing his transcriptions together with some<br>
        compositions of his own and others by Chourmouzios.<br>
        <br>
        <i>The Tameion Anthologias, either in 1st edition (Hourmouzios)
            <br>
            or 2nd edition (Gregorios)?</i><br>
        <br>
        No, they have not been republished till now. The transcriptions by<br>
        Chourmouzios differ in some details from those by Gregorios (only in some<br>
        analyseis of the signs; Gregorios is sometimes more 'conservative' in the<br>
        sense that he usually gives the analyseis through cheironomic signs; we can<br>
        say they are the 'same', with no true differences and equally faithful and<br>
        trustful. It would be very useful for someone to compare them)<br>
        <br>
        <i>The Anastasimatarion and Heirmologion
            <br>
            by Ioannes Protopsaltis?<br>
        </i>
        <br>
        Yes.<br>
        <br>
        <i>The Mousike Kypsele by Stephanos?</i><br>
        <br>
        Yes.<br>
        <br>
        <i>The books by Theodoros Phokaeus?</i><br>
        <br>
        A shorter version of the Pandekte (rich but not including so many chants<br>
        as that) is the ''Tameion Anthologias'' by Theodoros Phokaeus. Equally<br>
        recommended as the Pandekte but also including some very beautiful<br>
        compositions of his own. It is a 6 vol. set. but only three of them are the<br>
        original publication of Phokaeus, the other vols. being a compilation of<br>
        compositions of mainly later composers in photoproduction from various<br>
        books. I think you can start with this 3 vol. set (Vespers A&acute;, Orhtros A&acute;,<br>
        Liturgy A&acute;) leaving Pandekte for later. It's the recommended 'minimum'.<br>
        <br>
        PS. Of course one must know how to interprete the musical signs in these<br>
        books, as the formulas are written in a more synoptic way (as the Three<br>
        Teachers transcribed them). Books through which one can learn a lot (surely<br>
        not everything) for the function of the signs are a) Simon Karas'<br>
        Theoretikon. There are some small mistakes inside or interpretations that<br>
        are given as the only correct ones, while they are not so, but of course<br>
        this book is the source for these things, as Karas was the first to<br>
        systematize them. b) the book by Demetrios Nerantzis '' Symbole stin<br>
        ermeneia tou ekklesiatikou melous''. There are some mistakes in the ways of<br>
        analysis of some signs or formulas (due to mistaken understanding of the<br>
        readings of old treatises) and a lot of mistaken views on older signs and<br>
        their meaning (due to the same reason). The paleographic aspect of this book<br>
        is more or less false. But it can be very useful from a practical point of<br>
        view. c) My own book is not yet ready ! [I'm still like Sokrares; only oral<br>
        teaching ( :-) ]<br>
