        Simon Karas is probably the most controversial figure in Byzantine Music history
        of the 20th century. A number of his students and supporters place him amongst the
        greatest contributors to Byzantine Music ever. His opponents usually condemn most
        or all of his work and consider his musical views "heretic" and alienating from
        the traditional performance style ("ektelesis") of Psaltiki. Others (including the
        Authors) find positive and negative sides to his work. In this page, we present
        information regarding Karas' life and work.</div>

        Tribute to the life and work of Simon Karas from the radio show "From our Orthodox
        and Eastern Musical Tradition" of Lykourgos Angelopoulos and Konstantinos Angelidis,

        Έργα / Works</div>
    <div class="item-lessmargin">
        <span class="name">Method of Greek Music: Theoretikon</span>, book in two volumes
        published by Simon Karas in 1982, presenting the conlusions of his research on the
        theory and practice of Byzantine Music (for exact references see [<a href="http://www.gnl.gr/5+1/9/contgb.html">html</a>]).
        In this book Karas presents a new perspective of looking at Greek music. An example
        of this book where Karas studies and supports the older traditional practice can
        be found on our study regarding the mathema "Ton Despotin kai Archierea" [<a href="TonDespotin.html">html</a>].        Here is also the Kekragarion of first mode [<a href="../pdf/Karas-Kekragarion-FirstMode.pdf">pdf</a>]        and one Esperion (troparion) from his theory book (vol. I).
    </div>
    <div class="item-lessmargin">
        <span class="name">Method of Greek Music</span>, series of books published by the
        Association of Simon Karas containing exercises (parallage), hymns and folk songs
        written in Karas' extended Byzantine notation to be used as teaching materials in
        music schools. [exact reference pending].
    </div>
    <div class="item-lessmargin">
        <span class="name">Extended notation</span>. Karas (like many others before him)
        argued that the Three Teacher's notation is not completely suitable for capturing
        oral tradition. Therefore he proposed a number of extra symbols (their shapes borrowed
        from the old notation) that could be added to music scores to represent possible
        ornamentation(s) according to oral tradition. For a thorough coverage of the subject
        refer to Karas' theory book. A more or less summary of the philosophy of Karas regarding
        notation (coming from an unrelated source) and many explanatory examples of the
        proposed signs and their purpose and meaning was given by Dimitrios Nerantzis in
        this article [<a href="http://www.stanthonysmonastery.org/music/Nerantzis/index.html">html</a>].
        Here is another example of an enhanced score by Karas himself. It is the Kekragarion
        of first mode [<a href="../pdf/Karas-Kekragarion-FirstMode.pdf">pdf</a>] and one Esperion        (troparion) from his theory book (vol. I).
    </div>
    <div class="item-lessmargin">
        <span class="name">Ioannis Maistor Koukouzelis and his era</span>, book published
        by Simon Karas, aiming to uncover the myths regarding the life and work of Ioannis
        Koukouzelis and present credible evidence instead. Karas argues that there is a
        mix up of Maistor (not saint) Ioannis Koukouzelis with St. Gregorios Koukouzelis
        Domestikos of the Holy Monastery of Megisti Lavra of of Mt Athos who - according
        to the Menaion - was the one actually to receive the gold coin from the Theotokos
        (and not Ioannis). He also argues against Koukouzelis' Bulgarian background and
        places his life in the 12th century (for exact references see [<a href="http://www.gnl.gr/5+1/9/contgb.html">html</a>]).
        See also Koukouzelis' page on the Analogion [<a href="Koukouzelis.html">html</a>].</div>    <div class="item-lessmargin">
        <span class="name">Palaeography</span>. Karas spent a great deal of time and effort
        studying the evolution of notation from the early medieval times till his time.
        He published a book on his palaeographic research and made numerous conference presentations
        about it (for exact references see [<a href="http://www.gnl.gr/5+1/9/contgb.html">html</a>]).
        He fought against the Western belief that the long melismatic exegesis of the older
        repertoire by the Three Teachers was unfounded.</div>
    <div class="item-lessmargin">
        <span class="name">Short and long exegesis</span>. Karas supported that the older
        stenographic notation of Byzantine Music could be transcribed in both a long and
        a short manner. Here is a short exegesis (transcription) of "Fos Ilaron" by Simon
        Karas himself [<a href="../pdf/Fos_Ilaron_Karas.pdf">pdf</a>]. Michael Lagoudakis, who        scanned this transcription said, "I don't remember where I copied this from, but
        it should be the Akathist Hymn book by Constantinos Markos. The added markings are
        mine ... it is very interesting to see how the classic (slow) "Fos Ilaron" and this
        one match each other in structure. The slow vs. brief exegesis is a huge chapter.
        A common example of it (that precedes Karas) is the ancient Axion Estin in 2nd mode
        and its two exegeses: the brief one (most common) and the slow one found in the
        books of Raidestinos and Alexandros Byzantios (perhaps elsewhere, too)."    </div>
    <div class="item-lessmargin">
        <span class="name">Engomia</span>. book containing the traditional way (perhaps
        with the exception of explicitly notated double isokratema) of chanting the Engomia
        (Praises or Lamentations) of Great Saturday. The book contains music scores, the
        text of the Engomia and the accompanying verses. See also relevant page on the Analogion
        [<a href="Lamentations.html">html</a>].</div>    <div class="item-lessmargin">
        <span class="name">Preservation</span> Karas went to Constantinople in the late
        1930s with the aim to collect national treasures and safeguard them by bringing
        them to Greece. Angelos Boudouris gives a more detailed account of that effort [<a
            href="BoudourisMemoirs.html">html</a>]. The most important        treasure of all seems to be the collection of autograph manuscripts of Chourmouzios
        Chartophylax which were placed and preserved in the National Library of Greece since
        then.</div>
    <div class="item-lessmargin">
        <span class="name">Radio show</span> Many years of contribution to the presentation
        of authentic traditional Greek music from Greek national radio.</div>
    <div class="item-lessmargin">
        <span class="name">Recording Archive</span> While a head of a department of Greek
        national radio, he invited and professionally recorded many psaltai and choirs of
        his time. For instance he recorded the choirs of Athanasios Pettas, Konstantinos
        Katsoulis, Georgios Syrkas and others in the 1970s. Samples from that recording
        archive have been broadcasted by Lykourgos Angelopoulos in his radio show on national
        radio.</div>
    <div class="item-lessmargin">
        <span class="name">Folk Music</span> Karas travelled extensively around Greece and
        recorded around 50,000 folk songs. He wrote down many (all?) of them in Byzantine
        notation, some of which have been published in his "Method of Greek Music" series
        of books and have been played and recorded by his and other choirs. For his contribution
        to Greek folk music, the Academy of Athens awarded him a prestigious award towards
        the end of his life.</div>
    <div class="item-lessmargin">
        <span class="name">Recordings</span> Many recordings of chants and folk songs with

        [exact references pending].</div>
    <div class="item-lessmargin">
        <span class="name">Compositions</span> Karas left a number of his own compositions
        and transcriptions. Some of them have been published by Karas himself as examples
        in his own books and some by Panayiotis Pappas in his liturgy book and surely there
        are many of them that remain unpublished.[exact references pending].
    </div>
    <div class="item-lessmargin">
        <span class="name">Unpublished works</span>, a huge corpus of unpublished (due to
        lack of funds) manuscripts of the church year and other repertoire written by Karas

    </div>
    <div class="item-lessmargin">

        that time: "The teacher has formed the opinion that Karas is an intellectual man
