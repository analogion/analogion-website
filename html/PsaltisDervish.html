        Παράδειγμα Δερβίσικου Ύμνου (Μπέκτασι) / Example of Bektasi Dervish Chant [<a href="../mp3/Bektasi_Dervish_Chant.mp3">mp3</a>]        <p />
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis</span>: I would like to point out the great similarity
        in performance between Dervish and Byzantine chant. One could imagine Petros Lambadarios
        teaching such chants to his Dervish students with his ney.
        <p />
        Would the psaltai of parishes in the Ottoman empire be influenced by such chants?
        (or the opposite, were dervishes chanting "as the Greeks did")? I guess we will
        never know to which extent. Here I am talking about "performance" (yphos) not about
        the musical system (scales, rhythm, systems etc) which has been compared and studied
        in the past.
