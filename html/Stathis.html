    Gregorios Stathis was born in 1939 in Platania-Gerakarion, Ioannina. He received
    his musical education in Athens and later furthered his studies in Rome, Oxford
    and Copenhagen. In 1970 he was appointed at the newly established Institute of the
    Byzantine Musicology of the Church of Greece and currently he is its director. At
    the same time he is a professor at the University of Athens and the head of its
    Musicology department.
    <br>
    <br>
    Prof. Stathis' publications to date number well over three hundred and deal with
    various aspects of the Byzantine chant and Greek folk music. Among his books one
    must mention the monumental cataloguing project of the music mss preserved on Mt.
    Athos (three volumes have been published and other four are under preparation),
    his doctoral thesis "He dekapentesyllabos Ymnographia en te Byzantine mousike",
    "Hoi anagrammatismoi kai ta mathemata tes Byzantines melopoiias" (a work dealing
    with the anagrammatismoi and mathemata - a genre of the Byzantine chant) and "He
    exegesis tes palaias Byzantines semeiographias" (a book on the Old method of the
    Byzantine chant and its transcription into the New Method). Among ongoing projects
    one can single out the preparation of the detailed catalogue of the protographa
    in the New method, the catalogue of the mss of Gregorios Protopsaltes preserved
    in the library of Konstantinos Psachos and the catalogue of the music mss preserved
    in Meteora.
    <br>
    <br>
    Prof. Stathis has transcribed from the Old method a large number of the compositions
    by Parthenios Meteorites (18th c.) as well as the studying tool of the old sticheraric
    chant "Ho thelon mousiken mathein" by Panagiotes Chrysaphes the New (17th c.). At
    the same time he is active in the compositional field having set to music the two
    services of the Asmatic rite of the Great Church, Pannychis and Trithekte and the
    Nativity Kontakion by St. Romanos. He has also written music for the service of
    the consecration of a church and Sunday Prokeimena and Allelouiaria.
    <br>
    <br>
    Under Prof. Stathis' direction the Institute of the Byzantine Musicology became
    a leading research institution in the field of the Byzantine musicology. He was
    the chairman of the organising committees of two conferences on the Psaltic art
    held under the auspicies of the Church of Greece which were attended by the renowned
    Greek and foreign musicologists and chanters.
    <br>
    <br>
    Worth mentioning is Prof. Stathis' prolific cooperation with the late Archon Protopsaltes
    of the Great Church Thrasyboulos Stanitsas with whom he produced three LPs with
    music by Petros Lampadarios, Gregorios Protopsaltes and Petros Bereketes. He assisted
    the Athonite fathers with the CD "Hosios Simon" published by Simonopetra monastery
    and prepared the choir of Ormylia nuns for their recording of the vigil of St. Mary
    Magdalene.

    <span class='name'>The Masters of the Psaltic Art</span><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
        The choir of the Masters of the Psaltic Art was established in 1983 under the leadership
        of Prof. Stathis continuing the tradition of the IBM choir directed by Thr. Stanitsas.
        It consists of 24 chanters, the protopsaltai and lampadarioi of various churches
        in Athens, musicology students and researchers from the University of Athens and
        the Institute of the Byzantine musicology. The goal of the choir is the promotion
        of the Byzantine chant through the practical and theoretical excellence.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
        The choir took part in many concerts both in Greece and abroad: Russia, Italy, France,
        Cyprus, Israel, Armenia, Australia and the United States. Numerous recordings done
        by the choir feature the classical pieces by both Byzantine and post-Byzantine composers:
        St. John Koukouzeles, Balasios the Priest, Germanos Archbishop of Neon Patras. One
        should also mention the "Meteora ta hiera" dedicated to the Jubilee of the Meteora
        monastery and the CD "Agiorites melourgoi A" with works by the well-known Athonite
        composers.
