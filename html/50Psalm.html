        The 50th psalm is chanted at most Sunday Matins (Orthros) services throughout the
        year. Although there is modern music for it, most psaltai chant it by-heart, in
        fast tempo, faster than Heirmologic. In the books it is often described that it
        is chanted "Chyma" (Freely"). There is some variation in how psaltai chant this
        psalm nowadays. What is the most traditional way to chant this psalm? What do they
        do at the Patriarchate?

        Note: "Idou Gar Alitheian" is always chanted slowly when there is a Bishop/Patriarch
        presiding to give time for the Gospel to come out of the Altar and the Bishop to
        venerate it. Eis polla is chanted at the end of that verse. Then, back to fast tempo.

        Some psaltai chant it relatively slowly. This trend probably came from churches
        with large congregations taking time to kiss the Gospel. In some local churches
        in great feasts that can take up to half an hour! But many modern psaltai chant
        the psalm slowly regardless. The especially slow down in verses like "Kyrie Ta Cheilh
        mou Anoixeis" etc. which they perform solo and slower, in a kallophonic manner.

    <div class="text">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span>It has become customary to append some
        text to the beginning and the end of the chanted version of the psalm. In the beginning
        we add "Elehmon" and at the end we add "kai Elehson me o Theos". How traditional
        are those additions and why were they added? I don't know.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span class="name">S. Gugushvili:</span> Apart of the 2nd mode versions there're
        also ones in barys. According to Fr. Rigas in the Great Lent the 50th psalm is done
        in the Pl.4 evidently because "Tis metanoias..." is in Pl.4. As far as appending
        text to the Psalm verses is concerned, that's how all Psalms or Biblical odes were
        chanted in ancient times (remember also adding Allelouia to e.g. Douloi Kyrion verses).
        Maybe "kai eleison me o Theos" is a remnant (?) of this practice.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span class="name">D. Koubaroulis:</span> Apostolos Konstas mentions both text additions
        in his Typikon (early 19th century).
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <span class="name">G. K. Michalakis:</span> The 50th psalm and the 2 troparions
        which follow should last the time necessary for all to HEAR the psalm while venerating
        the TEXTUAL SOURCE of salvation they're asking for, the EVANGELION. ...As far as
        appending text to the Psalm verses is concerned, notice that I have done 2 versions
        of each of the FIRST and LAST verses. According to some, the last verse addition,
        "kai eleison me O Theos" has been added because the melody is LIMP (is missing syllables).
        For those who argue in this sense, it's an addition of MUSICAL necessity and not
        of any other traditional origin.. the same goes for the first verse. Compare the
        two (ALL my teachers have chanted thushow..; SOME, however, did not always use "ELEIMON"        when chanting the TROPARIONS (as opposed to ALWAYS using this addition on the first
        verse of the psalm).
