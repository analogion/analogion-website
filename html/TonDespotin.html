        Το ζήτημα / The issue</div>
    <div class="text">
        The controversial issue here is whether the soft chromatic fthora in the beginning
        of the piece signifies a change to Second mode or is it there just to remind of
        intervals and particularly of a high GA, so that the pentachord ZW-GA is a perfect
        fifth interval. The answer to this question affects (among other things) the pitch
        of KE immediately below ZW (the basis of the mode). If the fthora means Second Mode,
        then KE (which now becomes PA of Second Mode) must be low when the melody descends
        below it, otherwise it must be high, close to ZW which attracts it (as it happens
        in Barys Mode). On this page we prove with many examples that all Patriarchal psaltai
        did a high KE until Stanitsas in the 60's. From the recordings presented here it
        seems that Stanitsas, although he himself did a high KE earlier on, later introduced
        the practice of low KE in performance of this piece, confusing the psaltic world.
        Simon Karas was the first who publicly fought this innovation and supported the
        old Patriarchal tradition which required a high KE signifying no mode change. Unfortunately, he did not provide any reference
        recordings to support his views and this page fills that gap. Karas went on to say
        that this particular mode is what he called "Soft Chromatic Legetos". This is a
        purely musicological consideration that has not been examined in this page yet.
        <p>
        </p>
        Other arguments expressed by other people (see also discussion below) supporting the validity of a high KE are:
        <div class="item-lessmargin">
            Isokratema stays on ZW (BOY of supposed Second Mode throughout the relevant part
            of the piece. If it was Second Mode, then ison would move to PA (DI of supposed
            Second Mode).
        </div>
        <div class="item-lessmargin">
            There is no fthora or other sign of Chromaticism in the Old Notation manuscript (see below for a sample).
        </div>
        <div class="item-lessmargin">
            The soft chromatic fthora is placed at different places by different publishers
            of the piece in the New Notation. (see below for samples)
        </div>
        <div class="item-lessmargin">
            The same fthora appears in other pieces of Barys mode (like Anothen Oi Profitai
            ) but no Patriarchal psaltis does a low KE there, even those that do a low KE in "Ton Despotin". See relevant page on Analogion about Anothen ([<a href="Anothen.html">html</a>]).        </div>
        <div class="item-lessmargin">
            The same fthora is placed in other pieces of Barys mode (like in the Anthologia
            of Petros Ephesios) where it clearly has nothing to do with affecting KE and it
            is obviously placed to denote a high GA. The issue has been studied and presented
            by Lykourgos Angelopoulos in the introduction of that Anthologia, republished a
            few years ago by the Greek Byzantine Choir.

                    Initially, in his oldest recordings, he is very close,

            <p/>However, in "Anothen oi Profetai" ([<a href="Anothen.html">html</a>]) which is composed in the same        mode he clearly does KE higher than all the above (even
            though he puts a chromatic fthora in his version
