            Many theoreticians have disputed the existence of
                the Enharmonic genre in Byzantine music, at least with the definition of Chrysanthos
                (Mega Theoretikon, 1832). See, for instance, Panayiotopoulos' theory
                book. Simon Karas (Theoretikon, 1982) gives his own definition on what is Enharmonic
                genre and distinguishes it from "Hard Diatonic" in pieces that before were said
                to be all "Enharmonic" (e.g. Third mode). For now:<br>
        </div>
        <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
            <br>
            This is what Fr Charalambos Oikonomou says in his theory book titled "Byzantines
            Mousikes Chorde" (Pafos, Cyprus, 1940). Translated by D. Koubaroulis.<br>

        <div class="text">
            <span class='name'>"En</span><spanstyle="font-weight: bold;">harmonic Genre</span>. The Enharmonic genre in holy melodies
                with respect to psaltiki lacks its own klimaka (scale) and its own fthorai (modulation
                signs). There is no troparion or sticheron that is chanted wholly in Enharmonic
                melody. There are fthorai that it may use, however, it cannot apply them because
                they cancel each other, and each one of them acts on a note with its own scale ("ekasth
                energei epi tinos fthongou idias klimakos"). It also lacks special martyriai.
                In contrast, the fthorai of the Diatonic and Chromatic genre, each of them dominates
                a whole scale. As for the Enharmonic genre, there are only some theseis or isolated
                lines between the other two genres and even those are rare.<br>
                <br>
                The music teachers appear undecided as to the definition of the Enharmonic genre.
                For instance Theodoros Fokaeus composed an Axion Estin in Plagal Fourth Triphonos,
                similar to "Idou o Nymfios" and calls it "Third Mode Enharmonios" [example
                score]. See also in Pandekte, page 455. Chourmouzios names his Doxology from low
                ZW flat, Enharmonic. Georgios Biolakis and other music teachers want the sticheraric
                Plagal First mode to be Enharmonic or Minore of European music and each of them
                label enharmonic whatever melody as they like.<br>

                <span class='name'>Our enharmonic genre. </span>Our enharmonic
                genre is defined by its own scale, as in the other two genres, and has its own fthoras,
                from the so-called Enharmonic genre, acting on the range of a full scale. We preferred
                the fthora [spathe] which represents a sharp (diesis) and a flat (yphesis) and ditonon
                (two tones) from two elason tones. This fthora dominates a scale without need for
                any other fthora when descending or ascending, like this:
