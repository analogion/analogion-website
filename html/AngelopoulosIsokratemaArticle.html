A. Angelopoulos (director of the Greek Byzantine Choir)<br><br>translated by D. Koubaroulis<br><br>The term "isokratema" in Byzantine Music means the continuous horizontal<br>co-sounding  of the tonic of a mode or -more precisely- the tonic of a<br>tetrachord or a pentachord with the melodic line.  The word is<br>composite: "ison" and "kratema". Sometimes we see only the word "ison"<br>which means exactly the same thing, the "kratema" or "holding" of the<br>ison. In music, ison is the first and only sign of Byzantine notation<br>that is characterised as "the beginning, middle and system of all signs<br>of the Psaltic Art. Without ison, there is no voice ("fwnh" = melody?).<br>Ison is called "aphonon" (lit. mute) not because there isn't any melody<br>associated with it.  Ison can be counted ("metreitai") but not voiced<br>("fwneitai"). And depending on the amount of equal notes, the ison is<br>chanted". That is found in all the prefaces of the theories of the<br>old-method Papadike. From there it is, I think, that the etymology and<br>literal meaning of the term "ison" derives: the continuous vocal<br>repetition of the appropriate note each time, which note is called<br>"ison", is the so called "holding of the ison" that is, the<br>"isokratema". It is well known that the musical system of Byzantine<br>chant is monophonic, modal, purely vocal, written-down, with well known<br>composers and compositions that are artistic and complete musical works<br>even though they are intended almos exclusively for liturgical practice<br>in Church - which of course is the centre of the Christian's life.<br>However, there are also compositions that can be chanted outside the<br>Church like, for instance, "at the table" which nonetheless is a<br>continuation of liturgical congregation. Written tradition is<br>interpreted by oral tradition and complemented by it. The microtonal<br>variety and the effects of the signs are core elements of a complete<br>interpretation.<br><br>The isokratema, witnessed from the Byzantine times in manuscripts either<br>with the mention of the name of the person that does it ("vastaktes" =<br>holder/supporter) or with the definition of the job of a "vastaktes".<br>Having observed the above terminology in some compositions of<br>manuscripts, I could conclude that not all pieces were changed with<br>"vastaktes" but only those that explicitly said so. Equivalent to the<br>"vastaktai" of the East  in Western musical practice are: the four last<br>members (out of the seven) of Scuola Cantorum, that is the<br>archparaphonist and the three paraphonists (the first three members are<br>the primicirius, secondarius and tertius). So much with the evidence of<br>"vastaktai" (holders) of ison in the Byzantine period because, in my<br>knowledge, there is no evidence of written isokratema in composition, in<br>Byzantine as well as in the post-Byzantine period. After the<br>introduction of the new method of the 3 teachers (beginning of the 19th<br>cent) the first evidence of written isokratema in books dates around the<br>beginning of the 20th century. It is quite surprising that the first<br>notated isokratema in the 19th century is not found in books of the New<br>Method (of the 3 teachers) but in thos of another method called the<br>"Lesvios' system" (a system that was justifiably rejected by the<br>Ecumenical Patriarchate because it destroyed irreversibly the link<br>between the practiced method and the older methods of the centuries-old<br>musical system).<br><br>A parenthesis: The huge importance of the connecting link between the<br>older systems and the currently practiced one was pointed out and<br>demonstrated first by Simon Karas with the identification of the effect<br>of certain signs with oral (as well as written) tradition. Later<br>research proves gloriously ("panygerika") the correctness and necessity<br>of the views of Karas - let me mention the extremely well documented<br>doctoral thesis of Georgios Konstantinou that was approved last year by<br>the Ionian University. End of parenthesis.<br><br>So the first notated isokratema in the 19th century happens by Georgios<br>Lesvios in the book "Meliphonos Terpsinoe" a two-volume anthology<br>published in Athens in 1847. The texts were "converted" as interpreted<br>by  Georgios Lesvios from the method of the 3 teachers, to his own<br>method. In the preface of that work, Lesvios notes: "In the most well<br>known pieces of the second volume, we added the signs of change of the<br>bases (or the isa) which should co-chant softly ("ta opoia thelousi<br>ypadein ypechountes (isokratwsi)" the "isokratai" while the piece is<br>chanted as is observed by those chanting n Constantinople and indeed in<br>the Great Church. However, they (dk: the isokratai) should also be<br>musicians otherwise they can make mistakes". The phrase here "as it<br>happens" creates some doubts as to whether Lesvios heard and wrote the<br>isokratemata exactly as they were done in the Great church or that he<br>notated them following in general and "approximately" the standards and<br>the tradition of the Great Church. Both assiptions are equally possible.<br>The observation of this first evidence of written down isokratema is due<br>to philologist M. Xatziyakoumis and took place while cataloguing the<br>printed music books. I will not go into details regarding this notated<br>isokratema as I have already given my texts to musicologist Sotirios K.<br>Despotis, PhD candidate at the University of Vienna, who dealt in detail<br>with the subject (for more information see his final year dissertation<br>at the Ionian University titled "The application of the co-sounding<br>("synechetikou") system of Byzantine Ecclesiastical Music in Byzantine<br>Ecclesiastical Melos through Theory and Practice of the 20th century",<br>Corfu, 2002 and in a paper by the same author in the international<br>conference of Vienna University (3-5 Oct. 2002): "Die Isokratema Praxis<br>der Byzantinischen Kirchnmusik").<br><br>In 1902, the Protopsaltis of Smyrna, Misael Misaelidis publishes his<br>"Neon Theoretikon" consisting of 3 parts: 1) About our Ecclesiastical<br>music 2) About Ancient Greek Music and 3) Various Ecclesiastical Hymns<br>etc. In the third part and from page 63 onwards, where the per-mode<br>Cherouvika start, a capital I is written on the notes that the isokrates<br>should change the ison. Much later, in 1924, Stylianos Hourmouzios of<br>Cyprus will use  the same method (capital I) with the same meaning in<br>his book "Ecclesiastical Salpingx", vol. 3, Liturgy.<br><br>In the years of activity of the Patriarchal Committee of 1881-1883 we<br>can identify a trend to seek a more systematic manner of co-sounding of<br>the melodic line and the isokratema. Central figure in that attempt is<br>the Fanariot (Constantinopolitan) Archimandirte Germanos Afthonidis,<br>president of the Commitee. A very interesting piece of information that<br>involves Germanos was kindly offered by Protopsaltis and researcher<br>Konstantinos Markos. In a text by well known French musician L.<br>Bourgault-Ducoudray, the translation of which will be published by K.<br>Markos soon, it is mentioned that Ducoudray had repeatedly met and<br>discussed with Afthonidis on the possibility of some kind of co-sounding<br>support for the melodic line. Ducoudray suggested some solutions but<br>without success because Germanos would not accept them. In the end, the<br>French musician suggested to Germanos two co-sounding lines (deux<br>harmonisations) which Germanos accepted and they named them due to their<br>primitive simplicity (vu leur simplicite primitive) as "diplo ison"<br>("double ison"). I do not have any more information on the fate of that<br>work but quite possibly that could have been the inspiration of the<br>double supporting or co-sounding line promoted by K. Psaxos when he came<br>to Athens from Constantinople, as the first teacher of the newly founded<br>School of Byzantine Ecclesiastical Music of the Athens Conservatory<br>(1904) . On Psaxos' double co-sounding line we observe the following:<br><br>1.  He doubles parts of the melody in unison or an octave apart which<br>results in the ison to lie in the middle and the melody to move higher<br>or lower than the ison. When the second voice moves, the third is<br>holding the ison and vice-versa, when the third voice moves, the ison is<br>done by the second voice.<br><br>2. In this case the two voices chant together (in unison) while the<br>third holds the ison<br><br>3. All three voices chant in unison, without isokratema.<br><br>The above cases are observed in both syllabic and melismatic pieces. In<br>particular, the melismatic pieces differ in the melodic lines that are<br>suitable for solo ("kalofwnia"). In such a case, the ison is held by the<br>second or third voice in unison or as double ison (dk: two different<br>notes). The in-depth study of the system of the 8 modes as well as the<br>effects of the notation signs, led Simon Karas to build a teaching that<br>gives clear, complete and justified answers to the issue at hand. In<br>general, I could say that in the first half of the 20th century, the<br>trend for some kind of enrichment of the isokratema, in order to counter<br>the increasing popularity of Western polyphony, is quite strong.  And<br>Simon Karas himself goes a long way in a short period of time, from the<br>first recording of 1930 (by Melpo Merlie) until the formation of his<br>teaching on isokratema, on the basis of the system of the modes and the<br>effects of the signs of the notation. The opration of "double<br>isokratema", as he names it, is different from the co-sounding line<br>("synhxhtikh grammh") of Psaxos. Double isokratema of Simon Karas exists<br>when there are common notes when moving from one mode to another inside<br>a piece, with adjacent ("synhmmena") tetrachord (e.g. in cases of moving<br>from low First Mode or Plagal Second Mode to Papadic Fourth Mode Agia).<br>Whichever change of the isokratema has to follow the musical phrase from<br>the beginning, something which often is not so clearly visible and easy.<br>Especially in cases where a musical phrase can belong to more than one<br>mode, depending on how it is chanted, applying the characteristic<br>elements of this or the other mode. The structure of the pieces plays an<br>important role as to the placement of the isokratema. In his<br>"Theoretikon", S. Karas has a detailed teaching on the isokratemata of<br>all modes for someone who wants to read more on this subject.<br><br>Modern psaltic practice appears contraddicting with respect to<br>isokratema. On one hand there is a will for study, research and to<br>follow all the rules of our musical system. On the other hand, one can<br>see a carelessness ("proxeirothta") and adapting to the existing<br>dead-end practices of education and knowledge. The worst is the view of<br>isokratema using the logic of Western music and of vertical harmony<br>which has absolutely no relation to our musical system. And even worse,<br>the influence of such logic at the practical level, in cases where there<br>is no knowledge of Western music but a modern aesthetic understanding<br>which gets infuenced by Western and/or Eastern sources and remains<br>captive to manufactured sounds  ("typopoihmena akousmata") that do not<br>take into account neither the modal system nor the effects of the<br>notation signs. The in-depth study, complete knowledge of the structure<br>and operation of the system of the Octoechos (8 modes) as well as the<br>effects of the notation signs is required for a justified documentation<br>of isokratema.<br><br><span class='name'>L.
