<div class="heading">On makam Bestenigar</div>

Makam Bestenigar is one of the most popular makams of the external music. Here is its description from K. Signell's book "Makam: Modal Practice in Turkish Art Music"[<a href="../pdf/Signell-Bestenigar.pdf">pdf</a>, 72 Kb].  According to Yorgos Bilalis, the Greek name of Bestenigar is Plagal of First Mesos Difonon: difonia Zo-Pa + difonia Pa-Ga + a soft chromatic tetrachord Ga-high Zo flat givingthe sound of Naos (or pathetikos). Ga is natural being also the base of a new tetrachord.

<div class="heading">Doxologies in Bestenigar</div>

There are two well-known Doxologies written in Barys Diatonic and usually classified as belonging to Bestenigar: the slow Doxology by Iakovos Protopsaltis
and another one by Gregorios Protopsaltis.

<div class="heading">Issue</div>

From the above description of Bestenigar, when chanting the Doxologies of Iakovos and Gregorios, GA must be natural and DI must be flat.
DI is expicitely flattened in many places in classical scores of these two Doxologies. The kiari (mathema of external music) found in Gregorios Protopsaltis' manuscript also uses permanent
(crossed) flat to signify the lowered DI, see this excerpt [<a href="../images/Kiari-Bestenigar.jpg">jpg</a>, 1 Mb] (scanned from Fr. Hierotheos Tsonakas' book "Metabyzantina Romaika Asmata"). Similarly, highZO is also flattened with a crossed fthora on KE. On the other hand the oral tradition as expressed by Thr. Stanitsas maintains different intervals for these Doxologies:
raised GA and slightly flattened DI (not Sabah DI).

<div class="heading">Conclusions</div>

There seems to be a discrepancy between the written vs oral tradition. The following solutions can be proposed to resolve it:

<div class="item">1) Intervals of makam Bestenigar changed themselves and the oral tradition maintains correct intervals. But why is then DI flattened 
in classical scores and there is no indication of GA sharp?</div>

<div class="item">2) The Doxologies are wrongly labelled as belonging to Bestenigar. This is possible, however the conjecture does not explain why DI is explicitely flattened in classical scores.
It is also possible that flat DI explicitely notated in these two Doxologies implies a slightly flattened DI as
seen in Thr. Stanitsas' recordings.</div>

<div class="item">3) The oral tradition got the intervals wrong or due to some reason it on purpose performs intervals differently from written tradition.
This claim can be verified only after extensive study of available recordings of traditional chanters.</div>
