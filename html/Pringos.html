        Biography, Works and Other Information</div>
    <div class="text">
        Konstantinos Pringos was born in Constantinople in 1892 and died in Athens in 1964.
        He learnt to chant by teachers including Ioannis Palasis and Iakovos Nafpliotis.
        Between 1911-1913 he served as Archon Second Domestikos of the Great Church next
        to Konstantinos Klavvas.
        <p />
        In 1913 he left the Patriarchate (due to the very low wage of the position of Second
        Domestikos) to become Protopsaltis of the Church of St Dimitrios of Tatavla. Between
        1925-33 he moved to Thessaloniki and chanted in various churches around Northern
        Greece creating a good reputation between psaltic circles and a wave of followers
        of his psaltic style. In 1933 he returned to Constantinople and chanted in various
        churches.
        <p />
        In 1938 he was invited to become Lambadarios of the Patriarchate since Archon First
        Domestikos Anastasios Michaelidis who was the expected successor of that position
        had rejected the offer due to its heavy requirements (according to Angelos Boudouris).
        In 1939 he became Protopsaltis (replacing the ill and old Iakovos Nafpliotis) and
        served as Protopsaltis of the Great Church until 1959 approximately. During these
        20 years of his Protopsaltia he often visited churches in Constantinople and in
        Greece, invited to chant at their parish feasts. He became renowned for his majestic
        and hegemonic (as he used to call it) interpretation and superb voice qualities
        shown off in compositions written especially for such parish feasts which, as he
        used to say, were not meant to be chanted in the Patriarchal Church. He also taught
        Byzantine Music at the Theological School of Halki in the 50s.

    <div class="text">
        In the late 50s he became paraplegic to the point that he could barely walk up to
        the psalteri and that with the help of his friends that supported him. Around 1960
        he retired in Athens seeking medical treatment. He died in 1964 and was buried in
        the Third Cemetery of Athens. A few years later, some of his students and supporters
        with the initiative of Georgios Tsatsaronis built a monument grave for all Protopsaltai
        of the Great Church and moved the remains of Pringos there.
        <p />
        For some psaltai today, Pringos is considered the last of the so-called "old Patriarchal
        school" and his death meant the end of an era of Byzantine Chant. Despite that,
        his recordings had been treasured privately by some psaltai and only recently did
        they become available to all by websites such as cmkon.org, analogion.com and by
        CD publications such as those of Georgios Konstantinou. With the generous offer
        of recordings by many people (especially Georgios Michalakis, Basil Stavropoulos,
        Vasili Zacharis and others) analogion.com was the first to present the complete
        (to our knowledge so far) series of recordings of Pringos and Iakovos Nafpliotis
        made in early 20th century in what were the first ever recordings of Byzantine Chant.
        <p />
        During his life Pringos published informally half of the Anastasimatarion and Holy
        Week in collaboration with Avraam Efthemiadis who actually wrote down the pieces
        (probably because Pringos was not good at orthography as attested by Boudouris).
        A few years after Pringos' death, his students published as single books his Anastasimatarion,
        Megale Evdomas (Holy Week) and his Mousike Kypsele (Doxastarion) in a book series
 titled "Patriarchike Forminx". A collection of Pringos' festal Liturgy compositions
        was included in a Liturgy book published under his name by his admirer laywer Andreas
        Papandreou in 1974 together with compositions from other psaltai. Pringos' compositions
        for the Liturgy have been criticised by many as being non-traditional and being
        influenced by external music. This is evident also by the choice of some non-ecclesiastical
        modes (maqams) that label such compositions like Sabah, Houzam, Kurdi etc. He himself
        did not want them to be published since, as he once said to Avraam Efthemiadis,
        "the classical old melodies of the Liturgy are irreplaceable" [ref. Prof. Alygizakis'
        book, pending].
        <p />
        Archon Domestikos Angelos Boudouris wrote some previously unpublished information
        about Pringos at the time of Iakovos Nafpliotis and later. Contains comments by
        Nikolaos Raidestinos (son of Georgios Raidestinos Protopsaltis of the Great Church)
        about Pringos [<a href="BoudourisOnPringos.html">html</a>]. Raidestinos claimed        that Pringos was the last one who knew something about old traditional Byzantine
        chant. Nafpliotis thought the same, although both appear to have had reservations
        as to the future success of Pringos as Protopsaltis.
        <p />
        Other information about Pringos has been published in the book of Thrasyvoulos Stanitsas'
        biography published by Christos Tsiounis. For instance in that book it is mentioned
        that Pringos and Stanitsas did not get along very well although they both admired
        each other as psaltai. Stanitsas learnt a lot from Pringos as he himself says and
        as can be heard from his chanting. Stanitsas also said that Pringos was invited
        to chant the Doxastikon of Great Wednesday (Troparion of Kassiani) at other churches
        after the Patriarchate service. He added the following story: A friend of Stanitsas
        once asked him to go and listen to Pringos chanting the Troparion of "Kassiani"        and Stanitsas said "don't go". However his friend went and when he saw Stanitsas
        again he confessed that he would like to go every year and listen to Pringos chanting
        that piece. Stanitsas explained that that was the reason why he "objected" to his
        friend going earlier. He knew that Pringos' interpretation was captivating and did
        not want to "lose" his friend.
        <p />
        Also according to Stanitsas (from the same book), Pringos used to pick exactly the
        same base note pitches for the various pieces without using a tuning fork.
    </div>

        (Pringos with Thrasyvoulos Stanitsas, image from cmkon.org, click for original size)</div>
    <div class="text">
        Stylianos Tsolakidis, protocanonarchos of Iakovos Nafpliotis said that Pringos was
        very good but not as good as Iakovos Nafpliotis. He mentioned that Pringos often
        lifted the pitch of the basis of the mode chanted involuntarily resulting in being
        corrected by Nafpliotis during the chant (being pushed by Iakovos' arm!).
        <p />
        The associations of psaltai of the Evros and Kalavryta regions of Greece have been
        named "Konstantinos Pringos" in his honour.
        <p />
        Pringos' musical books are used sporadically at the Ecumenical Patriarchate up to
        this day (when musical scores are used).
        <p />
        He was the first director of the newly founded choir of the Friends of Music of
        Constantinople in the late 40s (see photo from a relearsal below).
        <p />
        Pringos fought against the introduction of polyphony in the Greek Orthodox Church
        and he used to say that "people cannot pray with songs". He rejected the claim that
        the slow papadic pieces resemble "amane" (slow exhibitionist style of singing developed
        mainly in Asia Minor and Constantinople in early 20th century).
        <p />
        It is said that both Pringos and Stanitsas were taught many of the secrets of Patriarchal
        chanting and order by Anastastios "Sobatzis" Michaelidis who was then First Domestikos.
        <p />
        According to Avraam Efthemiadis, Pringos was not highly educated however he understood
        and felt what he was chanting to the point of being ecstatic while chanting. He
        used to chant with the same majesty from the beginning of the Orthros (Matins) until
        the end of the Liturgy. According to Christos Tsiounis, Pringos often liked to chant
        a kalophonikos heirmos at the end of the Liturgy, especially "Efrikse Ge" by Panagiotis
        Halatzoglou.
        <p />
        Pringos did not appear to have much theoretical knowledge about Byzantine Music.
        He was an empirical psaltis (as most Patriarchal psaltai as attested by Angelos
        Boudouris) however his practical knowledge and musical memory were so advanced that
        he preserved a lot of the traditional elements of chanting to the newer generations
        of psaltai. His vocal range, chronos, attacks and phrasing are superb. His intervals
        are great most of the time although shaky during the end of his life probably due
        to his age and illness. His pronnunciation and general style resembles a lot that
        of his teacher Iakovos Nafpliotis. He did not use isokratema in most of his recordings
        as far as we know. A study on Pringos' intervals using spectral analysis has been
        performed by Tasos Fotopoulos and can be found here [<a href="http://www.oet.gr">html</a>]
        (oet.gr).
        <p />
        Pringos appears to have recorded three grammophone plaques in early 20th century.
        The plaques are mentioned in Panagiotis PAnagiotidis' book [reference pending] to
        be kept at the Aristotle University in Thessaloniki, Greece by the team of Prof.
        Antonios Alygizakis. There is no information as to what those plaques contain and
        when/if they are going to be published.
        <p />
        His chanting of kalophonikoi heirmoi is superb. He does not follow the music text
        note by note and he uses a loose tempo (free/eleutheros chronos). A very nice example
        is his recording of the kalophonikos heirmos "Pasan tin Elpidan Mou" of Petros Bereketis
        in Barys Mode. Elpidan Mou" published on tape by Athanasios Pettas.
        <p />
        Although Pringos (and Efthemiadis') analytic transcriptions of Patriarchal chanting
        were the first to become mainstream popular between modern psaltai they were not
        the first to be written. Former First Domestikos Angelos Boudouris had already written
        down analytically much of the Patriarchal repertoire of his time "as it was chanted
        in the Great Church" some 20 years before Pringos however his work remained relatively
        unknown until very recently.
        <p />
        Pringos was criticised by Angelos Boudouris as chanting to "show off" sometimes
        as well as for choosing a better wage instead of his Patriarchal education as Second
        Domestikos in 1913. When Pringos became Lambadarios he quickly dismissed his Second
        Domestikos (Prodromos Topaloglou) due to voice incompatibility and hired the then
        inexperienced Dimitrios Magouris. Boudouris (and Nafpliotis) did not approve of
        that action as it did not help Pringos get accustomed to the Patriarchal taxis.
        Soon after Pringos took over the Protopsaltia from Nafpliotis, Boudouris was quick
        to point out that such chanting does not have a place in the Patriarchal Church
        and criticised Pringos for having "innovative ideas" regarding the Psaltic Art which
        did not fit the conservative nature of Patriarchal psaltic roles. Pringos indeed
        deviated sometimes from the Patriarchal tradition when chanting around Greece in
        order to please his audience congregation but when asked why he didn't chant those
        pieces at the Patriarchate he always maintained that such pieces were only for the
        parish feasts and had no place at the Patriarchate. Despite such comments, the pieces
        became very popular between modern psaltai and started a trend that lead to secularised,
        exhibitionistic and western influenced chanting in the most sacred parts of the
        Divine Liturgy.
        <p />
        Probably the most well known Cheroubikon of Pringos is the so-called "Chorodiakon"        (choral) Cheroubikon in Plagal First mode. The naming of the piece (aren't all papadic
        pieces choral?) and the composition itself (western influenced) are unfortunate.
        Pringos started a trend of uncontrolled innovation in the Liturgical pieces especially
        by Thessalonikian psaltai like Athanasios Karamanis, Harilaos Taliadoros and others.
        <p />
        From a related page of cmkon.org [<a href="http://www.cmkon.org/Philosofia.htm">htm</a>]
        we quote the following about Pringos (translated by Dimitri Koubaroulis from the
        Greek passage below):
        <p />
        "In the introduction of his Mousike Kypsele, Konstantinos Pringos presents the Patriarchal
        style as "modest, simple and mystical" and that is was transmitted ear-by-ear by
        listening as he says on tape: "...because if I chant these things to you and you
        listen, you will be able to chant them like me in the future". And another time
        again: "... well done Mitso, you did great, you imitate me without having heard
        me, well done my son, it seems you have been born to be a psaltis". And another
        time he narrated the following incident: In one of his trips to Greece from Constantinople,
        after a Liturgy, the psaltai of that church gathered around him in the parish hall
        and were discussing with him about the Psaltic Art. He chanted a few pieces for
        them as he would often do. The protopsaltai and others in his audience asked him
        to hear them chant too in order to get his opinion. Indeed they chanted various
        pieces and in the end they all waited to hear the judgment of the great teacher
        who told them: "All of you guys, you have great voices, you know music, you chant
        in churches but you are not Psaltai. Why? Because you haven't listened." And to
        explain himself he would present the argument of a language and its accent which
        can only be learnt by ear".

        "Ο δε Κωνσταντίνος Πρίγγος στον πρόλογο του της Μουσικής Κυψέλης, χαρακτηρίζει το
        ύφος το πατριαρχικό «σεμνό, απέριττο, μυστικοπαθές», και για την μετάδοσή του με
        την ακοή όμως λέγει στην απαθανατίζουσα την φωνή του κασσέτα ο ίδιος τα εξής: «...
        διότι σε σας αν τα πω και τ'ακούσετε, θα τα λέτε μεθαύριο σαν κι εμένα». Και άλλη
        φορά πάλι: «...μπράβο ρέ Μήτσο, ωραία τα κατάφερες μα εσύ με μιμείσαι χωρίς να με
        έχεις ακούσει , μπράβο παιδί μου, φαίνεται ότι είσαι γεννημένος για ψάλτης». Kαι
        άλλοτε πάλι μας διηγήθηκε ο ίδιος: Σ' ένα ταξίδι του στην Ελλάδα από την Κωνσταντινούπολη
        και μετά από μια Λειτουργία μαζεύτηκαν στο τέλος στην αίθουσα του ναoύ οι ψάλτες
        και συζητούσαν γύρω από την ψαλτική τέχνη. Όπως συνήθιζε, τους έψαλε μερικά μαθήματα.
        Οι ακροατές του Πρωτοψάλτες κ.λπ. του είπαν σε μια στιγμή vα ψάλλουν κι αυτοί, να
        τους ακούσει, για να τους πει τη γνώμη του. Πράγματι έψαλαν και αυτοί διάφορα μαθήματα
        και στο τέλος περίμεναν όλοι να ακούσουν τη γνώμη του Μεγάλου Δάσκαλου που τους
        είπε: «Βρε παιδιά, όλοι σας καλλίφωνοι είσθε, όλοι σας μουσικά ξέρετε, όλοι σας
        στις εκκλησίες ψάλλετε, αλλά Ψάλτες δεν είσθε. Γιατί; Γιατί δεν ΑΚΟΥΣΑΤΕ. Και για
        vα γίνει πιο αντιληπτός χρησιμοποιούσε την παρομοίωση μιας ξένης γλώσσας και της
        προφοράς της, που δε γράφεται και ούτε διαβάζεται, παρά μόνο με το ΑΥΤΙ αποκτάται."    </div>

        his interview to Fr. Georgios Stathopoulos [<a href="Efthemiadis.html">html</a>].        He claims that Pringos did not have any students and that people presented him themselves

        students. Efthemiadis also did not believe that anybody after Pringos was as good

        It seems that Pringos never took seriously the publishing of his musical works.
        On the contrary, he seems to have opposed the publishing of his Liturgy compositions
        altogether [ref. from Hatziyakoumis CD series pending]. Fr. Georgios Stathopoulos
        mentions in the Necrology of Avraam Efthemiadis [<a href="EfthemiadisNecrology.html">html</a>]        that Pringos was motivated to compose his Patriarchike Forminx series by Avraam
        Efthemiadis, a close friend and partner of his in his musical work. It is said that
        generally Efthemiadis was trusted by Pringos to write down compositions under Pringos'
        name since "he knew how Pringos would chant them". Pringos is said to have reviewed
        Efthemiadis' transcriptions and made corrections.</div>

        <span class="name">Πατριαρχική Φόρμιγξ, Αναστασιματάριον / Patriarchike Forminx, Anastasimatarion</span>,
        First Edition. The material of this book was written up to the middle of Fourth
        Mode by Avraam Efthemiadis under Pringos' supervision and distributed informally
        in 16-page booklet series in Constantinople in 1952. After Pringos' death it was
        completed and published in the late 60s as one book by Dimitrios Nerantzis who transcribed
        the other half of the book from recordings he made on request while Pringos was
        in hospital. Unfortunately (as Nerantzis explains in the introduction of the second
        edition of this book) some of those hospital recordings (the part between Fourth
        and Plagal First mode) were damaged and lost. To complete the lost recordings, Nerantzis
        asked Archon Protopsaltis Thrasyvoulos Stanitsas to record the missing pieces for
        him as they were chanted by Pringos, which Nerantzis then transcribed and added
        to the book. The First Edition of the book had many typographic mistakes and many
        pieces (compared with other Anastasimataria) were missing probably due to the lack
        of recordings of those pieces.
        <p />
        <span class="name">Πατριαρχική Φόρμιγξ, Αναστασιματάριον / Patriarchike Forminx, Anastasimatarion</span>,
        Second Edition by Georgios Konstantinou in 2007 under the auspices of Apostoliki
        Diakonia Organisation of the Church of Greece. Here is an excerpt from Georgios
        Konstantinou's radio show where he talks about this re-edition (in Greek). The new
        dichrome edition uses a new font developed by Dimitri Papadopoulos and in comparison
        to the first edition it includes several new pieces transcribed from Pringos' chanting
        for the first time. However, the book is still missing many pieces compared to other
        Anastasimataria. The book comes with a double CD with pieces chanted by Pringos.
        For more information and audio samples listen to the following excerpt [<a href="../mp3/Konstantinou-PringosAnastasimatarion.mp3">mp3</a>,        11.7 Mb]. The addition of vertical bars and the notation of some of the melodic
        attractions by Konstantinou has been criticised as inappropriate and even sacriligious
        by some psaltai. More details [pending]. Konstantinou however mentions in the introduction
        of the second edition of Pringos' Holy Week that the reception of the Anastasimatarion
        by the psaltic community had been enthousiastic. Archon Didaskalos of the Apostolos
        Dimitrios Nerantzis also applauded the re-edition, claiming that it is a practical
        "psaltic Anastasimatarion" that he always dreamt of being available to psaltai.

            Evdomas</span> (Holy Week), Written by Avraam Efthemiadis under Pringos' review
        and first published informally in 1952 in 16-page booklet series in Constantinople.
        The booklets were combined to a single book edition in 1969. Even though many pieces
        were missing, this book became quickly the most popular Holy Week score for most
        modern psaltai.

            Evdomas</span> (Holy Week), Second Edition in 2007 by Georgios Konstantinou
        under the auspices of Apostoliki Diakonia Organisation of the Church of Greece.
        The book comes with two CDs with previously unpublished Holy Week recordings of
        Pringos. Konstantinou corrected the typographic errors of the first edition, added
        complex vertical bars and notated some melodic attractions as Konstantinou could
        hear them being performed by Pringos. A new font was used (as in the re-edition
        of the Anastasimatarion) and some pieces were transcribed from recordings of Pringos
        and published for the first time. Missing compositions for which Pringos did not
        leave recordings were added from older classical books. Also added were a number
        of liturgical texts to minimise switching between books during the services. The
        usefulness of the addition of vertical bars and the notation of the melodic attractions
        has been criticised as inappropriate and even sacriligious by some psaltai (details
        pending). More details about the book and a point of sale is here [<a href="http://www.apostoliki-diakonia.gr/diakonia/5-5-2006/diakonia.htm">htm</a>]
