            <i><font color="#ff0000">In the feast of Holy Cross, the Greek Typikon ("Diptyxa") says
                that the canon should be sung without leading verses&nbsp; ("aneu stixou").&nbsp;
                In Mt Athos, however, they use "Cross of Christ, save us with your power"&nbsp;
                ("Stavre tou Xristou, swson hmas th dynamei sou").&nbsp; What is going on? Shouldn't

        <br>
        <b>Fr C. Terzopoulos:</b><br>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">
            There are a number of differences between the taxis following in monasteries (not
            to limit ourselves to Mt Athos) and the city and town parishes.<br>
            <br>
            On the most simple level, they use different liturgical typika. In the Greek parishes
            the typika of the protopsaltai Konstantinos Byzantios and Georgios Biolakes are
            the standard. Regarding canon performance as defined in the Konstantinos/Biolakes
            typika, the stichologia of the odes are not used for kanons, but only during the
            great fast and then separated from the kanons themselves.<br>
            <br>
            Therefore, verses are always used for kanons, except of certain great fast days,
            very much in the way that the stichologia of the entire odes&nbsp; for the kanons
            are not used every single day in the monastic typika (Sabas/Studite).<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <b>D. Koubaroulis:</b><br>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">
            Of course. I didn't mean to compare monastic and "civic" typika I just cannot understand
            why some "city canons" have verses (for instance "Most holy Theotokos save us" ("Yperagia
            Theotoke Swson Hmas") and some others don't. What do mean by &lt;&lt;stichologia
            of the odes&gt;&gt;? I only meant the stixo before each troparion of the ode e.g.
            "Glory to you, O God, Glory to you" (Doxa soi o Theos emon doxa soi"). Is that called
            "stichologia of the odes"?<br>
        </div>
        <tt></tt>
        <p>
            <b>Fr C. Terzopoulos:</b></p>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">
            The simple answer is that the typikon, in the case of parishes the Konstantinos/Biolakes
            typikon, tells us when to use verses and when not to use verses. Below, however,
            is a piece of the 'why?'.</div>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">
            Of essence to understanding the answer to the question you're asking is the background
            of how kanons developed and, hence, are done in the monastic Sabas/Studite liturgical
            typika. Why? The urban, cathedral typika used by the Greek, Bulgarian and to an
            extent Romanian churches are based on the Constantinopolitan practice of the Patriarchal
            Church as it reached the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century.<br>
            <br>
            Now, in the adaptation of the monastic typikon to the cathedral churches, something
            which began after the latin conquest of Constantinople (see St Symeon of Thessaloniki
            [megale he charis tou semera] and Ioannes Phountoules), certain things were simplified
            since people with families and jobs, (1) don't normally wake up at 2 or 3 AM and
            (2) can't normally spend three to four hours doing morning prayer.<br>
            <br>
            Jumping to the 18th and 19th century, the Konstantinos/Biolakes typikon reflects
            certain adaptations to the monastic typikon as it was practiced in the Patriarchal
            Church and those parishes under its care, as I already said. One of the main differences
            is the complete lack of a diataxis for agrypnia (vigil) in this typikon. Also, the
            first and trithekte hours disappear, except for during the great fast. The vespers,
            apodeipnon, mesonyktikon, orthros and ninth hour remained, as far as the daily office
            is concerned.<br>
            <br>
            In the services that remained, certain elements were de-emphasized, the assumption
            is, as an economia to save time. One of the elements of the orthros that disappears
            during the ecclesiastical year, except the great Fast is the stichologia of the
            odes. Taking a jet-trip through hymnographical history, we can say that the hymnographic
            genre of the kanon is directly connected with the ancient custom of chanting the
            biblical odes after the stichologia of the Psalter. In fact, on a daily basis the
            parish churches still chant the final ode of the Theotokos.<br>
            <br>
            Now, a little of how the kanon fits into the stichologia of the odes. Just as the
            antiphonal kanons are nothing more than psalm verses chanted in exchange with short
            troparia or troparia refrains called ephemnia, the kanon poetry was meant to be
            chanted with the verses of the nine odes.<br>
            <br>
            If you look in the Horologion (in the orthros) or at the end of the book called
            the Psalter <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="http://users.forthnet.gr/ath/frc/hymnbooks.html">
                &lt;http://users.forthnet.gr/ath/frc/hymnbooks.html&gt;</a> you'll see that
            the nine biblical odes end with indications for 8, 6, 4, etc. verses, just like
            the evening and ainoi psalms. Just like today it is often observed that chanters
            will skip the verses of the evening psalms, chanting the first two and then jumping
            to chant only as many verses as are needed for the hymns they're going to chant,
            the same holding true for the Ainoi psalms of the orthros, in time something even
            more drastic occurred with the odes, they were completely ignored, except for the
            ninth. (Note: While the stichologia of the odes outside the great Fast is called
            for in the present typikon, this is not the case for the evening and ainoi psalms.
            They should both be done. In fact, G. Regas states that the ainoi psalms of the
            orthros hold the same central place of importance as do the evening (Kyrie ekekraxa)
            psalms of the vespers.)<br>
            <br>
            Now, leaving the historical development (Part I), we can move to liturgical practice
            (Part II), and hopefully clear up the issue for you...
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Part II. The stichologia and the monastic liturgical
                practice.</span><br>
            <br>
            Dealing only with what is necessary to answer your question, we should take a brief
            look at present monastic practice with regards to the stichologia of the odes and
            the kanons of the orthros. To deal with all the various situations would be a bit
            involved since there are three main ways in which the odes are used in the orthros.<br>
            <br>
            The first example is the easiest to comprehend. On days when the kanons of the Parakletike
            are used, except Sundays, the first choir begins to chant the first ode (Ex 15)
            in the mode of the first kanon: 'I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed
            gloriously. The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.' Then the second
            choir chants the next verse, 'The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become
            my salvation&#8230;' The first choir the next, and so on, until they reach, 'and
            the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea'. Then the first choir says the
            next verse, 'The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake&#8230;,' and immediately
            adds the first heirmos of the kanon. Then the other choir chants the next verse
            of the ode and adds the next troparion of the kanon; thus, each chants one verse
            and one troparion of the kanon. In this way 14 hymns are used, 12 with the verses
            of the ode and Glory and Both now for the last two. This is done for each ode. I'm
            keeping things as short as possible.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now the second situation is the stichologia of the odes on Sundays, commemorations
            of celebrated Saints when the kanons of the Parakletike are not used, as well as
            pre-festal and after-festal days of the feasts of the Lord and Mother of God. In
            these cases we do not do full stichologia of the odes, but use only some of the
            verses as follows: The first choir begins to chant the heirmos of the first ode
            of the kanon without any verse. Then the second choir, again without any verse,
            chants either the heirmos again or the first troparion, depending on how many troparia
            there are. Then the first choir says the verse, 'I will sing unto the LORD, for
            he hath triumphed gloriously. The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea'
            and adds the next troparion of the kanon. Then the second choir chants the next
            verse, 'The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation&#8230;'
            and adds the next troparion of the kanon. The first choir chants the third verse
            of the ode, 'The LORD is a man of war' and the next troparion, and the second choir
            the fourth verse, 'Pharaoh&#8217;s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea'
            and adds the next troparion. The rest of the verses of the ode, from 'The depths
            have covered them' to 'sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina' are
            abandoned. The first choir then goes directly to the verse, 'Then the dukes of Edom
            shall be amazed' and chants the next troparion, until the verses of the ode end.There
            are other stipulations for fore-feasts and after-feasts, as well as the stichologia
            of the odes being simply read, apart from the kanons during the great Fast, but
            then there is another situation that brings us closer to the answer to your question.
            This would be a fifth variation of how the stichologia of the odes occurs. This
            situation includes feasts of the Master, such as the Universal Exaltation of the
            Precious Cross, the Nativity of Christ, 26th of December, 1 January, Epiphany, Transfiguration,
            Lazarus Saturday, Pascha and others. On these special days, there is no stichologia
            of the odes at all. Only the use of special verses, such as the one for the kanons
            of the Cross, 'Cross of Christ save us by thy power'.<br>
            <span style="font-family: monospace;">
                <br>
            </span>Now let's try to understand the 'why.<br>
            <br>
            I didn't give you all the variations of the stichologia of the odes because there
            would be another four we'd have to visit and this is already taking too long. However,
            all that I described to this point was necessary to help you understand what's actually
            going on with the verses of the kanons.<br>
            <br>
            When we look at the different ways the odes are used throughout the year for different
            kinds of feasts we see that the greater the feast, the less of the odes that are
            used. What would be the reason for this? I've not actually seen it written anywhere,
            but common sense of having experienced the whole thing in practice tells me that
            the greater the feast, the more emphasis that is placed on the festal kanon. For
            the greatest feasts, the stichologia is completely absent, thus 'stepping aside'
            (so to speak) for the complete emphasis of the festal kanon(s).<br>
            <br>
            Now, in the present Konstantinos/Biolakes typika, all the circumstances of the stichologia
            of the odes, except for the Timiotera (first half of the ninth) and the reading
            of the odes on the weekdays of the great Fast, were ignored. They just aren't there.
            So what *is* there? On each and every day what is there are the special verses for
            each kanon, Glory to Thee, O God, or Glory to Thy Resurrection, O Lord, or Most
            holy Theotokos, save us, etc., *except* for certain great feast days, like the Exhaltation
            of the Cross, the Transfiguration and some others (I'd have to search the Typikon
            for others that I don't know off the top of my head). Why? It seems to me that the
            reasoning would be the same as I suggested above in the pure monastic practice.
            Since the special verses are used daily, on certain special feasts the verses are
            abandoned in order to put more emphasis on the festal kanon.<br>
            <br>
            That's what makes sense to me and I hope it helps answer your question.</div>
        <b>D. Koubaroulis:</b><br>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">
            I now understand how we came to sing verses before the troparia. However,&nbsp;
            one thing still doesn't make sense. If we omit the verses to&nbsp; emphasize the
            festal kanon, why don't we do the same for big feasts
            <br>
            like Pascha? And the fact that the verses are used daily is not always relevant
            since in big feasts like the Exaltation of the Holy&nbsp; Cross for instance a special
            verse could be used ("Stavre tou Xristou.. " etc), different from the every day
            ones.<tt> </tt>

            I don't pretend to have the definitive answers. I'm just sharing what makes sense
            to me at this point.<br>
            <br>
            Regarding your mentioning Pascha, the only thing I can share is that,&nbsp; it being
            the feast of feasts, we hold to more exact practice.<br>
            <br>
            Let me just say, I would not say to someone that they would be 'wrong'&nbsp; for
            using the verses for the kanon of the feast of the Exaltation, they&nbsp; would
            simply be following a more ancient typikon. The practical aspect is that the rest
            of the clergy need to be clear as to which taxis would be followed throughout the
            year. It's a pastoral/practical issue at this point. You suggestion of creating
            'another' special verse, I&nbsp; think, would not be ideal.<br>
            <br>
            Of course you can say, 'the fact that the verses are used daily is not always relevant&#8230;',
            but at some point when the typikon was being codified it was, so, somehow, it is.:-)<br>
            <br>
            At that point it's a matter of attitude toward the typikon and taxis, who, how and
            when we will prefer older usage to new in our particular&nbsp; parish, monastery,
            church, chapel, etc.<br>

            Much to my suprise, last Sunday (the one after the Exaltation of the Holy Cross)
            the festal kanon, which was the actual canon of the feast had a verse "Glory to
            You, O Lord, glory to You". This could be explained by Fr Constantine's assumption
            that the post-feast it is not as big a feast as the actual feast and therefore the
            use of verses is recommended. I found that interesting.<br>

            The Canticles are the texts (from the Old Testament for Odes 1-8 and the New Testament
            for Ode 9) which are the basis of the poetic troparia which are (in monastic practice)
            interpolated after the verses of the Canticles (in the same way that the stichera
            are interpolated after the Psalm verses at "Lord, I have cried").&nbsp;&nbsp; The
            Greek "Great Horologion" usually includes the shortened form of these canticles
            (which is the form used on Sundays, daily during the Pentecostarion period, and
            also during Afterfeasts, etc.). There is also a slightly longer form used on "ordinary"
            days and the full form used in the Great Fast.&nbsp;&nbsp; Father Constantine gave
            a detailed description of the use of these in several recent posts.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The Slavonic "Hirmologion" gives the texts of the three different forms with rubrics
            on how to insert the Troparia of the Canons.<br>

            In usual parish church practice the Canticles are omitted entirely (except for the
            first part of the Ninth Canticle, the Song of Mary). In Russian practice the Canticle
            verses are replaced by various refrains (the standard ones being "Glory to you,
            O Lord, glory to you", with "Most Holy Mother of God, save us" before Theotokia).&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The Paschal Canon uses the refrain "Christ is risen from the dead" except for the
            Ninth Ode.
            <br>
            <br>
            Hearing the refrain "Glory to you, O Lord, glory to you" on a day other than a Great
            Feast tells you nothing about the rank of that day - it is merely the normal non-monastic
            daily usage which does not distinguish between days other than by the omission of
            the Song of Mary.

        Now I understand! the canticles were included in the original psaltirion book that
        was published in 1800's in Greek.
