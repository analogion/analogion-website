        Resurrected medieval music to be heard for the first time in 500 years Music which
        has not been heard for over 500 years will be played at 6pm on Saturday 26
        May at 6pm in the Chapel of St Peter&sup1;s College, Oxford, following painstaking
        reconstruction of medieval manuscripts by scholars at Oxford and the Ionian University,
        Corfu.<br>
        <br>
        The evening service of Vespers according to the ancient Rite of the Great Church
        of Hagia Sophia, Constantinople was lost following the capture of Constantinople
        by the Ottoman Turks in 1453. It will be recreated on the 26 May by the renowned
        Greek Byzantine Choir of Athens, under the direction of Lycourgos Angelopoulos,
        who have flown over specially to take part in the service. The Rt. Rev. Dr Kallistos
        Ware, Greek Orthodox Bishop of Diokleia, and Spalding Lecturer in Eastern Christian
        Studies at Pembroke College, Oxford, will preside.<br>
        <br>
        Dr Alexander Lingas, a researcher at St Peter&sup1;s College, who worked on deciphering
        the manuscripts with Ioannis Arvanitis of Ionian University, said: &sup3;Many people
        who think nothing ever changes in the Orthodox Church will be immensely surprised.
        Radically different from the monastic form of Vespers sung today in Greek and Russian
        churches, this service represents a tradition of urban Christian worship that was
        celebrated in Byzantium for nearly a thousand years. Utterly forgotten after 1453,
        its texts and music survive in a small number of manuscripts ranging in provenance
        from<br>
        8th-century Constantinople to 15th-century Thessalonica. Thanks to earlier scholars,
        particularly those working during the latter half of the 20th century, enough of
        these sources had been identified to allow me to undertake study of the Byzantine
        cathedral rite as a graduate student, resulting in an article on vespers and a doctoral
        thesis on Sunday matins.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    &sup2;Soon after I arrived at St. Peter&sup1;s with a British Academy Postdoctoral
    Fellowship to continue my work on Byzantium&sup1;s urban liturgy, the Master (Professor
    John Barron) suggested that I combine my scholarly and practical interests&#8249;I
    have sung Byzantine chant in Orthodox churches since I was a teenager&#8249;by performing
    a cathedral rite service in the college chapel. Although I could draw together a
    service from the sources at my disposal, I knew it was vital to engage the choir
    of my former teacher Mr. Angelopoulos, which was really the only ensemble capable
    of doing justice to the music. Thanks to a generous grant from the A.G. Leventis
    Foundation, the participation of the Greek Byzantine Choir was assured and a date
    was chosen, enabling me to begin assembling the materials for the service. Because
    the musical manuscripts are in an obsolete and rather ambiguous form of staffless
    notation, I then sought the assistance of my friend and colleague Ioannis Arvanitis,
    who kindly agreed to produce the scores in modern Byzantine notation required by
    the choir. My final task is to complete a booklet of the service&sup1;s texts and
    rubrics for the presiding clergy, for whom this will all be a rather new experience.&sup2;<br>
    <br>
    The service is free and open to the public. For further information please contact

        The Greek Byzantine Choir of Athens is the leading interpreter of Byzantine chant
        in the world today. Its director Lycourgos Angelopoulos practised as a lawyer before
        studying music under Simon Karas. He is presently director of music at the church
        of St. Irene in Athens, where he teaches chant at the Athens, Philippos Nakas and
        Skalkottas Conservatories. As a soloist he has premi&egrave;red the numerous works
        by contemporary Greek composers and has sung Western medieval music as a core member
        of Marcel P&eacute;r&egrave;s' Ensemble Organum. For his service to church music
        the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I bestowed upon him the title of First Cantor
        (Protopsaltes) of the Archdiocese of Constantinople.<br>

    <div style="text-align: justify;">
        The service follows the rubrics of the so-called 'Typikon of the Great Church' edited
        by Mateos, with the exception that we have added the normal ending to cathedral
        rite vespers because we will not be following Vespers with readings and Pannychis
        (cathedral rite compline).<br>
        <br>
        As for why it changed after 1453: the answer is complex, but part of the answer
        is that all the big city ancient basilicas were turned into mosques and their choral
        foundations dissolved. According to St. Symeon of Thessalonica (d. 1429), it was
        actually the Latin conquest of 1204 that disrupted the cathedral rite's celebration
        in Consantinople. Following that city's recapture by the Byzantines (Romans), the
        cathedral rite was apparently not fully restored at Hagia Sophia. Perhaps this was
        due in part to the monastic party's takeover of the patriarchate during the Paleologan
        period, as well as what St. Symeon indicates was the greater popularity of
        the Palestinian monastic rite's Divine Office. At all events, the cathedral rite
        was celebrated daily in Thessalonica's cathedral until that city's second and final
        fall to the Ottomans in 1430. Both according to St. Symeon and the evidence available
        in musical MSS, cathedral rite vespers continued to be celebrated occasionally elsewhere,
        particularly on Saturdays and the eves of feasts.<br>

            Comment:
        </h4>
    </div>
    I<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">t seems not unlikely that in the not-too-far-distant
        future some bishops will give their blessing to a revival of the old choral
        service in some places. The difficulty, as Symeon of Thessalonika already
        notes, is that they require a rather considerable group of singers and other
        servants of the Church to perform as prescribed, and it would require a deal
        of effort a no doubt some expense to achieve such a revival.</span><br>
    <div align="center">
        <h4>
            A. Lingas:
        </h4>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">
            The issue of liturgical personnel is somewhat of a red herring, as I pointed out
            in my OCP article. One needs to read between the lines of Symeon's rhetoric, for
            the 14th/15th-century Athonite All-night Vigil is musically and textually more complex
            than the old asmatic office, which featured mainly psalms with refrains.<br>
            <br>
            As for the revival of these services, in a limited way it has been going on in Greece
            for a while. In the 1970s Prof. Ioannes Phountoules of Thessalonica published practical
            editions of two minor cathedral offices: Trithekte (an afternoon service sung during
            Lent) and Pannychis (cathedral-rite compline). His colleague Prof. Alygizakes has
            published some original musical settings of the refrains for these services in
            a volume of music for students at their university chapel, which suggests that they
            have been performed.<br>
            <br>
            More recently, Prof. Gregorios Stathis of the University of Athens wrote a complete
            setting of Pannychis that was first celebrated (if I remember correctly) in 1994
            and published--by no less than Apostolike Diakonia, the official publishing house
            of the Church of Greece--in 1999.<br>
            <br>
            What makes the Oxford event different is 1) that we are the first to revive one
            of the major offices; 2) we are the first to do a cathedral rite service with chant
            from the medieval manuscripts, rather than newly composed music in the received
            Byzantine style.<br>
