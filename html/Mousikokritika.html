            On Ioannis Protopsaltis</span><br>
        <br>
        <pre wrap="">par 36. <br><br>Ioannis, as his predecessors served well the music of the Great<br>Church. He belongs to the line of the great Protopsaltai of the Great<br>Church of the 19th century. He served for many years in the<br>Patriarchal Church. He was a teacher, had a nice voice ("kallifwnos")<br>and carried the tradition of the Patriarchate. <br><br>par 37. <br><br>Ioannis was also a publisher of musical books. Monumental is his<br>publication of the 4-volume Pandekte. The pieces of the Pandekte are<br>classical. The performed exegesis (transcription) may be condensed,<br>however it encompasses in its musical lines the classical character of<br> melos ("tin klassikotita tou melous"). It is a blessing that the<br>publishers of Pandekte did not change any of the pieces and they left<br>them as Gregorios wrote them. In that, they showed great respect and<br>that makes this publication superior over any other previous<br>publication" (dimitri: here Boudouris probably means previous Ioannis'<br>publications).<br><br>par 38.<br><br>"The important and great advantages of that publication we read in the<br>Preface of Pandekte by Theodore Aristokles: Pandekte includes not only<br>the necessary pieces for the daily usage in Church but also many other<br>that is useful for the extension and variety of Ecclesiastical<br>chanting. Most of these pieces were made by the wisest musical<br>teachers of the ancient Church therefore not only for their art but<br>also for their ancient age, tehy are invaluable and deserving every<br>respect and tribute as they were preserved by Divine Providence from<br>the effect of all-changing time ("tou pandamatoros chronou")"<br><br>par 39. <br><br>"For the wider distribution of his new publications, Ioannis had the<br>custom of attempting improvements "kallwpismon" on the ecclesiastical<br>chants included in his books. This action of the Protopsaltis can be<br>seen, without fear of judgment, as an innovation of Ioannis, which<br>changed the musical lines of the chants, transcribed from Petros'<br>notation. Through his improvements he claimed that he presented the<br>melos more musical ("mousikwteron") and more artistic<br>("texnikwteron"). Justifying himself for his innovation he wrote in<br>the Preface of the Heirmologion 1839: "Becasue some musicians are<br>chanting out of rhythm ("paratonws") and overlooking commas and<br>periods they don't pronounce the words and their meanings naturally,<br>for that reason I modified not only the accents of the words suitably<br>according to the commas and periods but also I improved the pieces<br>according to the way they are already chanted in the Great Church".<br>And he adds this: "I undertook this publication which I enriched by<br>improving ("oper kallwpisas eploutisa"). <br><br>par 40. <br><br>"Such modifications attempted on the ancient melos affected not only<br>the rhythm and the movement of the melody in many places but in some<br>places changed the expressibility ("ekfrastikotita") of the melos<br>itself. In general, the improvements and innovations of Ioannis<br>publications, despite the variety they presented in comparison with<br>the older publications, they are deemed by us as having contributed to<br>the change ("alloiwsin") of the ancient melos which was given to us by<br>the transcriber teachers." <br><br>par 41. <br><br>"Living in a time not very distant from that of the transcribers,<br>Ioannis should have published exactly what he had received from them,<br>without any addition, respectfully and fanatically. His commercial<br>calculations however won against the professional conservatism of the<br>teacher. His publications are also blamed "katakrinontai" for the fact<br>that they worked as a precedent for his successors who went on to<br>publish their own books professing themselves as music-publishers<br>("mousikoekdotes")". <br><br>par 42. <br><br>"Ioannis did not only innovate in his publications where he "improved"<br>the ancient melos but he badly served the Church from a technical<br>perspective as well. He abolished the limits between the various kinds<br>of composition. He was the first to mix papadic lines into sticheraric<br>compositions". <br><br><img            alt="" src="separator.jpg" style="width: 142px; height: 44px;"><br></pre>

        <pre wrap=""><span            style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>par. 154<br><br>"As for the old melodies, one should not expect to learn them first<br>theoretically and then practically. Indeed, no. As with any other art,<br>the same holds for music; with practice one can gets to learn it.<br>Here, the things that take precedence are practice ("praxis"),<br>exercise ("askesis"), aural training ("akoustiki synitheia") and<br>application through the vocal instrument. Here, the theory of music<br>does not play a role. Because theory is the sum of knowledge acquired<br>through practice and exercise of the various melodies. The theory of<br>music is known well by the master of this art who, without doubt,<br>knows well ("katexei") the musical praxis in full." <br><br>par. 155<br><br>"Contrary to what happened in the past, modern people want to learn<br>the BM art from theory books. They assume and consider it guaranteed<br>that from books alone they will be able to master the secrets and the<br>details of this music. This is a vain hope. Such books, detailed and<br>written with such a technical musical goal, do not exist. (dimitri: 19<br>July 1938)."<br><br>par 156<br><br>"The few theoretical writings that exist are incomplete ("elliph") and<br>unsuitable ("oxi katallhla") to teach BM because these books fall<br>behind ("kathysteroun"). Books always fall short in comparison to<br>practice in the musical art, as art.  The writers cannot, even if they<br>wanted to do so, expose what happens in the art as a whole. Art is<br>unbound ("adesmeuth") and unlimited ("aperioristos"). Its range is<br>that of long-year practice on it. It is learnt only by the great<br>technical ("texnhtas") musicians, from the masters. Which theoretical<br>book writes in a detailed manner for a musician this way to mastering<br>("myhsin") all the secrets of his art? None whatsoever. Besides, the<br>master is a master for himself. He has the right ("dikaioutai") to own<br>("katexei") the secrets of his art. In other words, art is not learnt<br>with books. Nobody can achieve to learn an art without devoting to its<br>practice. Without putting effort, great effort combined with patience<br>and perseverence indeed. Learning an art is the result of will, first<br>and foremost, then exercise ("askisews"), continuous exercise. Every<br>art is first praxis, first exercise and then gradually becomes theory.<br> ("kai vathmidon ginetai theoria"). That's how music always evolved as<br>an art. This art was not written, was not notated, however it was<br>exercised in practice."<br><br>par. 157<br><br>"... to chant the exegemena (analytic) texts, a written guide was<br>needed for the students of the new method."<br><br>par. 158<br><br>"Such a guide was edited by Chysanthos of Madytos. Unfortunately,<br>despite his scientific theological education, he found it tough<br>("epelagwsen") in the work he had undertook. Inadvertedly he got<br>perplexed inside mathematical calculations in his effort to define the<br>scales of Ecclesiastical music. His theory book did not manage to<br>facilitate the students regarding the practice of this art. Rather the<br> opposite happened, he made it more difficult and complex."<br><br>par 159<br><br>"Chysanthos' failure ("apotyxia") to define existing knowledge of the<br>theory and practice of Ecclesiastical music was primarily due to the<br>fact that he wasn't a master of this music, which was always developed<br> and preserved up to his age, by the Patriarchal teachers. Chrysanthos<br>was totally ignorant ("pantelws amyhtos") regarding the Byzantine<br>musical art. It is therefore totally anticipated for his theoretic<br>work to contain different things from those relevant to the practice<br>of the Eccl. melos. He didn't know that, with their exercise and<br>practice, the Patriarchal teachers were following different<br>fundamentals ("akolouthousan allas vaseis") regarding the Byzantine<br>musical system. As a result, chaos was observed regarding the<br>execution of  Eccl. melos, from students of BM using Chrysanthos'<br>theoretical work."<br></pre>

            On notation</span><br>
        <br>
        <pre wrap="">par. 214<br><br>"The notation of the exegetai (Gregorios and Xourmouzios), is based on<br>that of Petros Labadarios. However, certain signs of the old notation<br>were rejected <b
            class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>although they were useful
            and necessary<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> for the<br>pronunciation ("apaggelia") of ecclesiastical melos. The exegetai used<br>only those signs from the old notation to show the "quantity"<br>("poson")  of melos. The signs related to the rendering ("parastasin")<br>of the "quality" ("poiotita") they didn't use, *as they should have<br>done*. That is the cause of what is happening today. Those who chant<br>from the analytic ("exegemena") notation interpret them strictly,<br>following the writing of the exegetes (transcriber) in a dry and deaf<br>manner without any <b
                class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>variety<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> and analysis of the lines. And that is<br>because the purpose of the exegesis was to capture only the quantity<br>of melos"<br><br>par 215. <br><br>"With time, a difference was observed with respect to the<br>interpretation of ecclesiastical chant. Those who learnt from<br>transcribed texts were chanting pieces differently ("kata allin<br>vasin"). Those that learnt from Petros' texts, were chanting according<br>to the ancient tradition ("opos ta dietirisen i arxaiotera paradosis").<br><br>par 216. <br><br>"In contrast to the non-Patriachal psaltai, the Patriarchal teachers<br>preserved the ancient tradition as that was captured by Petros' notation."<br><br>par 217. <br><br>"Even after the death of the last master of Petros' notation, Nikolaos<br>Stogiannou Labadarios, the succesor Patriarchal psaltai preserved the<br>older tradition. This is explained by the fact that ** although they<br>would see texts in the new notation, they would interpret them<br>according to Petros' notation **".<br><br>par 218. <br><br>"That is the cause of the difference between the Patriarchal and<br>non-Patriarchal psaltai. The former making an impression with their<br>rendering of the pieces unlike the latter who didn't succeed to<br>present the pieces nicely ("terpna") and pleasurable to the listeners<br>("kai euxarista eis tous akroatas")"<br><br>par 219. <br><br>"From the above we conclude that Ecclesiastical chant is ** badly<br>chanted and badly represented ** due to the shortcomings of the<br>notation of the transcribers. And while this is the case, we will<br>never achieve the goal of uniform chanting in all churches in general. <br>On this, I believe that the problem can only be addressed by one means<br>, not without its difficulties. All chants must be captured<br>appropriately and suitably as dictated by the Patriarchal tradition.<br>Only then we will achieve a uniform system of chanting". <br><br></pre>

            On his own notation</span><br>
        <pre wrap=""><br>par. 240<br><br>"... This notation, is based ("sthrizetai") on the notation of Petros<br>Labadarios and those after him Petros Byzantios and Manouel Byzantios,<br>enhanced ("symplhroutai de") with the advantages of the notation of<br>the exegetai. I believe that this combined notation achieves to<br>capture the ancient melos of tradition as per quantity, quality,<br>chronos and rhythm (dimitri: see comments below) suitably. This<br>notation presents the movement of the melody ("thn poreian tis<br>melwdias") on the basis ("epi th vasei") of Petros' notation and it<br>manages to capture the traditional ly still preserved melos in the<br>Patriarchal church in the days of my teacher Iakovos Nafpliotis. This<br>notation can be called from now on the notation of the musical<br>tradition ("h grafh tou melous ths mousikhs paradosews"). This<br>notation that I am using in the composition of the melos of tradition,<br>was approved and considered as very ecclesiastical and suitable and<br>simple and easy by my teacher Iakovos to whom I respectfully submitted<br>texts written in this notation. After his approval I started writing<br>down the various musical pieces."<br><br>In the previous paragraph he defines the difference between chronos<br>and rhythmos:<br><br>par. 239<br><br>"It is observed that every ecclesiastical piece goes according to a<br>specific rhythmic pattern ("wrismenon rythmikon typon"), defined by<br>the time units ("xronikwn moriwn") of each rhythm ("rhythmikou<br>podos"). The time units ("xronika moria h xronikai monades") taken<br>("lamvanomena") in a systematic fashion form the rhythm. *Every<br>troparion can be chanted by chronos ("kata xronon") and by rhythm<br>("kata rythmon")*. However, what dominates in the musical melos of the<br>troparion is the rhythm which is given to it during chanting by the<br>psalti who is chanting it."<br></pre>

        <br>
        <tt>p. 87<br>
            <br>
            "He was of unknown parents (an illegal child) and was raised under the<br>
            care of the Great Church under the Patriarch Anthimos (Koutalianos).<br>
            He was given the name Kyriakos (stress at the last o). He attended the<br>
            school of Greek Merchants, the central priest school and in the Great<br>
            School of the Nation of which he gratuated with excellent marks. He<br>
            served as a Patriarchal kanonarchis under Konstantinos Byzantios.<br>
            Later he became an immitator of Georgios Raidestenos in wearing a raso<br>
            and hat ("skoufon") without being ordained. For that reason he was<br>
            often called "o kalogeros" (the monk).<br>
            <br>
            He had a good voice ("kallifonos"), a very powerful voice<br>
            ("brontofwnos"), an excellent interpreter of the traditional<br>
            mathemata, characterised by a serious ("sovaron") ecclesiastical yphos<br>
            (style). Unimmitable in the rendition of ecclesiastical chant,<br>
            flawless in his chanting. No deviations from the norm, no off-pitch<br>
            notes. Everything that Kyriakos chanted was ecclesiastical.<br>
            <br>
            Weird ("idiotropos") in his thinking and idiosyncratic ("idiorythmos")<br>
            in his life, he was often changing the churches he was chanting at<br>
            because of his weirdness. In chanting, he was always moving or rather<br>
            dancing on the analogion.<br>
            <br>
            He served as the right chanter of "Hagia Triada" of Peran reqarded by<br>
            15 ottoman golden pounds/month. He had made a good reputation, he<br>
            entertained and satisfied the congregation with his chanting. People<br>
            were flocking ("etrexe") to hear him as they did for G. Raidesteno of<br>
            whom he (Kyriakos) was equal ("efamillos"). In GR's age, when he was<br>
            the right chanter of St Nikolaos in Galata, Kyriakos was his left<br>
            chanter and managed to immitate him perfectly.<br>
            <br>
            He was contesting GR in reputation whom he exceeded ("yperevainen") in<br>
            the fast pieces while GR was better in the slow pieces. Kyriakos was<br>
            unimmitable in his chanting, uncontested in chronos when he was<br>
            chanting (this last sentence may be translated differently as well<br>
            "asynagwnistos de eis ton xronon otan epsalle").<br>
            <br>
            Due to his experience in BM, in 1888 he was meant to be appointed as a<br>
            Labadarios of the EP after the retirement of Nikolaos Stogiannou (IN's<br>
            teacher). This never happened because of the opposition of G. Biolakis<br>
            (dk: who didn't want someone better than him at the left analogion as<br>
            AB clarifies elsewhere) who finally brought his own man Aristeides<br>
            Nikolaidis as the new Labadarios.<br>
            <br>
            The teacher Kyriakos wes fanatically devoted to the ancient pieces,<br>
            not favouring the modern compositions of his time. Althoug he was<br>
            better than all, he never blamed any of his colleagues. In his work he<br>
            was using the old notation of Petros Labadarios; he wasn't aware of<br>
            the new notation.<br>
            <br>
            His was of chanting was imprssive and totally ecclesiastical. He<br>
            preserved the Patriarchal yphos till the end. He passed away in the<br>
            parish of St Nikolaos (Top Kapi) in his 70s around 1914.<br>
            <br>
            He was one of the most weird in manners among the chanters of his time<br>
            and also the most money-hungry. Rumour has it that he divorced his<br>
            wife because she ate four fish in one meal.<br>
            <br>
            His students include Triantafyllos Georgiadis, Konstantinos Mpekiaris,<br>
            Gerasimos Pavlides and Dimitrios Tsitsos.<br>
            <br>
            -- footnote<br>
            Another story about Kyriakos is that once the Patriarch Ioakeim the<br>
            3rd saw him wearing a secular cap ("fesi") instead of his usual hat<br>
            ("skoufo") he told him "Either take off the raso to be exact or wear<br>
            the hat so that people can recognise you".<br>
            <br>
            People used to call him "Zeimbekis" because he used to shave very<br>
            strangely like an Anatolian Zeimbek and because usually he was scruffy<br>
            and dirty "atimelitos kai ligdwmenos"). In Galata, the Cephallonians<br>
            would say "let's go to hear Raidesteno, others would say "let's go to<br>
            hear Zeimbeki".<br>
