        The following historical recording was discovered and offered to all by Jameel Abraham
        who said the following about it "My great-aunt pulled this recording from her attic
        a few months ago before she died. It looks as though it was recorded specially for
        my uncle Elias Joseph Nassif in 1942. My great-uncle died in 1963, so this recording
        has probably not been played for 43 years. It was on 1/4" reel-to-reel tape. It
        is an extremely rare recording I presume, perhaps even one of a kind of Metropolitan
        Samuel. He was a student of Mitry Al Mur I believe. I hope you enjoy it."        <p />
