            Harilaos Taliadoros was born in Thessaloniki in 1926. He was distinguished for his
            excellent voice and musical talent from his childhood. His teacher in Byzantine
            chant was Protopsaltis Christoforos Koutsouradis from Chios. In 1942, at the age
            of 16, he was appointed the Lambadarios of the church of Agios Therapon by ever-memorable
            Gennadios, the then Metropolitan of Thessaloniki and at the end of the same year
            he became the Protopsaltis of the same church. In 1944 he moved to the church of
            Saint Fanourios and John the Baptist where he stayed until 1952 when he was called
            to the church of the St. Sophia (a significant cathedral of Thessaloniki) by Metropolitan
            Panteleimon to succeed Protopsaltis Socrates Papadopoulos. Greatest impact on Taliadoros'
            formation as psaltis had his acquaintance with Archon Protopsaltis Konstantinos
            Pringos, whom he first met in 1945. Harilaos Taliadoros currently is still the Protopsaltis
            of St. Sophia where he has been faithfully serving the Church for well over 50 years.
            He is a prolific composer and his numerous books provide an excellent source of
            sometimes traditional and other times personal analyseis of musical theseis found
            in classical editions of Byzantine chant. Despite his overall traditional style,
            he has been criticised for having introduced some polyphonic chants in his publications
            as well as his church repertoire. Worth mentioning are his teaching activities in
            various music schools in Thessaloniki where he has trained hundreds of students
            thus contributing to the preservation and dissemination of the authentic Byzantine
            chant. He has been invited to chant to many feasts in Constantinople, various places
            in Greece and overseas. He was honoured to have chanted with Protopsaltis Thrasyboulos
            Stanitsas at various occasions. Among his students one can single out Athanasios
            Bougiouklis, Angelos Kounas, Christos Chalkias, Theodoros Vasileiou and Metropolitan
            Hierotheos Vlachos. In recognition of Harilaos Taliadoros' important contributions
            to the Byzantine chant and his services to the Church, the Ecumenical Patriarch
            awarded him the offikion of the Archon Protopsaltis of Archdiocese of Constantinople.
