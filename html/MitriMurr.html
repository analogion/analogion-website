            Mitri el-Murr was born in Tripoli (Lebanon) al Meena on November the 7th 1880, as
            he grew up his father the priest Elias tought him the principles of reading and
            writing, later on he read the Holy Bible by a blind teacher her name was Refka Kazkala.
            The beauty of his voice started to show since he was a little young boy and so did
            his talent in singing and his tendancy to music. In year 1893 his father sent him
            to Kefteen's school (Lebanon) in the Koura area and he left school one year later.
            Then he began studying the ecclesiastical music and the Oriental Arabic music with
            Yousef (Joseph) el Doumani who was a well known teacher and psaltis in Antioch,
            he was the brother of the Patriarch Maletios el Doumani the second. Young kid Mitri
            learned the 8 Byzantine modes so quickly and learned to chant them well. They said
            that when he was 15 years old chanted in the church of Tripoli and he stood infront
            of his teacher (as a lambadarios or left psaltis). In late year 1896 he went back
            to Kefteen school and focused on studying language with the linguistic and historian
            Issa Eskandar Maalouf(1869-1956) and he (Mitri) taught music in in one of that schools
            classes although he was a young boy, and he composed there a doxology on the Hijaz-Kar
            Maqam. After the death of Yousef el Doumani, Mitri stayed a psaltis in the Meena
            Tripoli church (Lebanon). in year 1903 he was appointed by the patriarch Maletios
            el Doumani to be the music teacher in the theology institute of Balamand's monastery
            (Lebanon) where he taught student the ecclesiastic hymns according to the byzantine
            way. Among his students there were students with beautiful voices that became all
            later bishops, they are Trephen (or Triphon?) Ghrayeb late bishop of lattakia(Syria),
            Niphon Sabba bishop of Zahle' (Lebanon) and Epiphanios Zayed bishop of Akkar (Lebanon)
            and Alexandrn Jaha bishop of Homs(Syria) and Ignatios Hrayke' bishop of Hama(Syria)
            and Samuel Dawoud bishop of New York, an thus we can say that bishops who lead the
            ecclesiastic chanting during half a century were Mitir students. In year 1907 he
            got married to miss Nazha the daughter of Dr. Mousa el Doumani and the grand daughter
            of his master and teacher Yousef el Doumani, they had 9 children, 6 boys: Fuad (which
            later on he proceeded his father's work and published most of it), Phillip, Auwni,
            Elias (still chanting till this day), George, Nicolas. and three girls: Salwa, Evet.
            Zareef. In year1912 he went with the patriarch Grigorios Haddad the fourth in a
            tour to some places of the patriarchate of Antioch and Mitri was given afterwards
            the rank of the Protopsaltis of Antioch (I don't think that the word Archon Protopsaltis
            was used in these days, or if it wasn't well known?!! But Mitri was a Protopsaltis
            with no Archon- prefix) and in year 1913 the Patriarch Grigorios was invited to
            Russia to lead the celebrations of 300 years of the Romanov's family ruling Russia,
            he was accompanied by a huge croud including Mitri and they departed in a ship from
            Beirout (Lebanon). In Russia the Tsar gave Mitri two medals one of them was the
            medal of St Anna.. on his way back, Mitri stayed a while in Constantinopole and
            met some artists that were interested in Byzantine music, in Constantinopole he
            was appreciated and admired, he also participated in a huge Divine Liturgy where
            he chanted a Polychronion for the ecumenical Patriarch, as an echo of this visit
            some of his musical compositions were published in the musical magazine there. In
            year 1916 he went to Damascus (Syria) and stayed there till the end of the First
            World War which allowed him to participate in the patriotic movements there, and
            he was close to the leaders of the Arabic cause back then. After the war he went
            back to his home city Tripoli (Lebanon) and chanted in the Meena church. In year
            1924 he moved with his family to Beirout (Lebanon) and lived there and started doing
            business, he was appointed by the Bishop of Beirout Yerrasimos Msarra to be the
            protopsaltis of St Nicholas' church. In year 1930 he traveled to USA after an invitation
            of friends there and he was warmly welcomed by the Syrian and Lebanese people living
            there, he was celebrated and honored. One year later he went back home to Beirout
            and depite his growing business (trading) he kept the hard work in music and composing
            as well as being the Protopsaltis of St Nicolas' church there, he also taught music
            in a school there or two. He died on August 31st 1969 aged 89 years old. Some of
            the medals he got during his life besides those of the Russian Tsar were the medal
            of St Paul and Peter given by the Antioch patriarch Alexandros Tahhan the third
            in year 1956, also the medal of St. Georgios by the king of Greece year 1960, plus
            the Lebanese deserveness medal, also the St Mark medal by the Alexandria patriarchate.</div>
