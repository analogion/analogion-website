                    It is not clear whether Xourmouzios considers the
                        effect of the signs both on ascent and descent although that is the most reasonable
                        understanding of the text.

                    He doesn't speak about the permanent diesis.He also claims that the permanent signs,
                    the enharmonic sign, the normal yphesodiesis as well as the absence of a sign all
                    have the same effect in well known theseis (such as the one he presents as example).
                    He also supports the view of not writing the signs at all in such theseis and rely

        Here is the <b>Kekragarion of Petros Efesios, </b>
        <br>
        a student of the 3 Teachers of the New Method,
        <br>
        from his Anastasimatarion,
        <br>
        published in Bucharest in 1820.<br>
        We study this in relation to the same piece from the
        <br>
        <b>Anastasimatarion of Ioannis Protopsaltis</b> published
        <br>
        by the Zoe brotherhood in Greece (1981 edition).<br>
        
        <br>
        <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">a) Does the enharmonic fthora in (a) have exactly
            the same effect </span>
        <br/>
        <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">as a crossed (cross on top of circle) fthora? Theoretically

        <span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis</span><br>
        <br>
        It's use here is to pull up BOU... PE (PetrosEfessios) has TWO BOus,
        <br>
        and, for economy of symbols, uses ADJEM to take care of both.
        <br>
        Now, Ioannis Protopsaltis (IP) uses third mode scale..
        <br>
        by definition it is ENHARMONIC (NOT diatonic) so GA DI is ALREADY LARGE..
        <br>
        (as it is in PE BEFORE he puts adjem...
        <br>
        so adjem here is to GUARANTEE a VERY UPRAISEd BOU....
        <br>
        to make sure we don't "miss it"..
        <br>
        So, a) PE = IP acoustically<br>
        <br>
        Nobody ever explained 0+ clearly... I had spoken to Matthaios Andreou...
        <br>
        he didn't have much to say except what I've stated : ascent/descent differences.<br>
        Tsolakidis = " den einai to idion". What else can I say?
        <br>
        the rest is LINES I've heard and repeated that I eventually LINK to the neumatics...
        <br>
        I have never chanted Ephesios Kekragarion with Tsolakidis...
        <br>
        Yet, I've chanted Kypseli, and there are similarlines. So, I just make
        the "connection".<br>
        I'm sure Tsolakidis learned all this by Iakovos who would tell him "den einai to
        idio"...<br>
        Therefore, I cannot INSIST that what i do is the ONLY correct way of doing things...<br>
        But I have heard VERY few people sing Tritos like Tsolakidis...
        <br>
        So, what they have to say isn't SO important.
        <br>
        At least I say what my sources are...
        <br>
        Where does everybody come up with their ideas..<br>
        <br>
        <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">b) The phrase in brackets appears with the crossed
            (circle on top of cross) </span>

            of Ioannis Protopsaltis. </span>
        <br/>
        <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Does that make any difference in performance?</span><br            style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">
        <br>
        <span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis<br>
            <br>
        </span>Yes....
        <br>
        In PE, I'd do it "pathetitikos", with NO grimace.... it becomes supplicatory "sad"...
        <br>
        In IP, I'd do a "GRIMACE" on the second Zo.... it doesn't mean that the Zo necessarily
        <br>
        goes up (the computer will tellus", but is is "SPECIAL"        <br>
        ( I do the same grimace I did for the katanyktiko troparion..)<br>
        I said same GRIMACE and NOT same INTERVAL...
        <br>
        The "grimace" gives a supplicatory yet "questionning" type of "hearing"...<br>
        something like " insisting parakelesma".
        <br>
        So, in the beginning of the recording of PE, I do ONE with GRIMCE
        <br>
        and the second as I suppose the PE score is indicating.
        <br>
        I'm trying to say that there are MANY melodic Formulae, NOT only in MELISMS
        <br>
        and DEVELOPMENTS, but in INTERVALS as well, as far as Third mode is concerned....
        <br>
        it is one of the "richest" interval modes... it alternates between diatonic
        and enharmonic so exquisitely...
        <br>
        So, b) REGARDLESS of INTERVALS (even if ALL ZO frequencies WERE to be the same),<br>
        PE and IP are NOT acoustically the same..
        <br>
        <br>
        <font color="#ff0000">c) Is ZW in (c) flat/natural diatonic/sharp? Would it be executed
            differently is the enharmonic
            <br>
            fthora in (b) was a crossed hyphesis? </font>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis<br>
            <br>
        </span>Yes, as mentionned above, REGARDLESS of any potential frequecy differences,
        <br>
        there is a GRIMACE effect on the SECOND Zo.
        <br>
        first Zo PE=IP<br>
        second Zo [PE ='pathetic parakalesma"]
        <br>
        and [IP GRIMACED "insisting parakalsma]....therefore PE NOT= IP<br>
        <br>
        <font color="#ff0000">Why do we need the diatonic fthora on GA to end on PA in the next
            phrase?

        <span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis<br>
            <br>
        </span>Bou is not as sharp, but Di AND KE are slighly pulled down....<br>
        (DI in its DIATONIC position, and KE in a lower that diatonic (that it, in
        "tempered") position,
        <br>
        with "CHEWING" to gurarantee all these intervals.... becomes again 'supplicatory"..
        <br>
        IP doesn't need to add anything, because the PSALTIS KNOWS that the line is interpreted
        as such..<br>
        <br>
        <font color="#ff0000">d) Is (d) a ZW flat or not? The same thesis is explicitly given

        <span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis<br>

        </span>It is NOT natural (it's not as if I had put a fist mode fthora of Pa on Ke...

        YET, IT MAY ALSO be chanted as such...
        <br>
        It may ALSO be "sadenned" = by doing an enharmonios adzem.
        <br>
        It all depends on the WORD and what the psaltis wishes to express.
        <br>
        Here, I'd do it betwen Adjem and natural..<br>

        <font color="#ff0000">e) c) Is ZW in (e) flat/natural diatonic/sharp?
            <br>

            (f))?</font><br>

        <span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis<br>
        </span>
        <br>
        Anaysis of e) uses a little Ni as well (but with a GOOD, HIGH interval)... the Zo
        shouldn't be too flat..
        <br>
        If I choose the "pathetic" version, the c) is Adjem.
        <br>
        Otherwise, it is "grimaced and raised a little bit (a least "psychologically")<br>

        <br>
        YET? conclusion cadences, even in barys, are "BRIGHTER"...
        <br>
        Zo hyphesis and Ke are done with a "smile" and do not sound "pathetic"......
        <br>
        now, does the INTERVAL change as compared to some initial cadence, only the computer
        will tell...<br>
        <br>
        <font color="#ff0000">(h) Could the diesis (sharp) on Bou be replaced with an enharmonic

            <br>
        </span>Probably...<br>
        Yet, an adjem Ga bou "slurs" a bit the bou... (really keeps it "stuck" to the Ga).<br>
        <br>
        <font color="#ff0000">(i) Zw is flat there. Why? Because we are in a diatonic mode and
            Zw is always flat on descend? If that is the case,
            <br>
            how does this flat compare with the other two flats i.e. the crossed yphesis and
            the enharmonic yphesis?</font><br>

        <span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis<br>
        </span>
        <br>
        In the recording, I do it flat and less flat as well...
        <br>
        There is no need to make is sound "pathetic", and we don't spend too much time on
        the Zo...
        <br>
        <br>
        The GA-Di and DI-KE should be HIGH.... (so it is NOT just diatonic....)
        <br>
        Adjem would make it sound like barys, and "pathetic"...<br>
        <br>
        <font color="#ff0000">(j) Is that ZW flat the same as in Barys (Enharmonic) mode?<br>

        </span>
        <br>
        THREE factors: the INTERVAL, the GRIMACE and the DURATION of the ZO...
        <br>
        TWO factors DIFFERENTIATE this Zo from Barys..
        <br>
        If you wish to make "eparsis" sound supplicative, then do a Barys adjem..
        <br>
        (adjem "pathetic" requires a VERY CLOSE KE-Zo interval,<br>
        a LONG duration AND a CHEWY, ROUNDING of mouth
        <br>
        (NOT= to "smile grimace" second Zo on 0+)
        <br>
        There is no need for all this in this line...
        <br>
        therefore the Zo hyphesis here is DIFFERENT..<br>
        <br>
        <font color="#ff0000">(k) ZW is undoubtedly very sharp there.<br>
        </font>
        <br>
        <span class='name'>G. K. Michalakis<br>
            <br>
        </span>There is no doubt...
        <br>
        The REAL question is "what should the Zo of esperIni be"?
        <br>
        With 0+ it would be flat...
        <br>
        Without 0+, since we're "diatonic", it's still low..<br>
        There are those who'd use a PA fthora on KE and thus do this Zo as NATURAL..<br>

        GOOD remark... boils down to almost a KLITON... we're in HARMONIC here,
        <br>
        NOT diatonic cadence on PA..... EXACTLY.. but BOU isn't very much upraised...<br>

        YES... upraised.. there are those who raise it more ( to natural level)<br>
        and those who do so les (but it in NOT kept on Adjem level)..<br>
        It stays that way until enopiOn sou, where it comes down again...<br>

        In diiiiiiikaios, it is NOT adjem, and we can do an analysis.
