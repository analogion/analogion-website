            <p/>Where
                did he come from?
            
            <p/>Quote from OCA website (posted by S. Takis): 
            
            
            <p/>Saint John Koukouzelis, a native of Dirrachia (Bulgaria), was orphaned
            in childhood. Endowed with a very fine voice, he entered the
            Constantinople court school. He found favor with the emperor John
            Comnenos (1118-1143) and became a chief court singer. The
            sumptuousness and luxury of the imperial court bothered the pious
            youth. Once, when asked what he had eaten for dinner, he replied,
            "Beans and peas." The name Koukouzelis (beans and peas) stuck with him
            ever after.
            
            <p/>John began to seek ways to escape the enticements of the court, as
            well as a marriage arranged for him by the emperor. By the will of
            God, John met an igumen from Mt. Athos who had come to Constantinople
            on monastery business. John revealed to the Elder his desire to leave
            the court. The Elder blessed John to come to the Holy Mountain. There
            John was accepted and tonsured a monk.
            
            <p/>He was given the obedience of tending the monastery's flock of goats.
            He took the flock to remote areas of the Holy Mountain to graze. There
            in the wilderness the youth was able to to pray, contemplate God, and
            sing the divine hymns in solitude. Charmed by the angelic beauty of
            his voice, the animals gathered around him and listened as though
            entranced.
            
            <p/>Out of modesty and humility the singer did not reveal his gift to the
            brethren. But once, a wilderness dweller overheard his moving pastoral
            song and informed the igumen. St. John then revealed to the igumen
            that he had been a court singer. He tearfully implored him to remain
            in the wilderness with his flock.
            
            <p/>The igumen was afraid that the emperor would find out that his
            favorite court singer was on the Holy Mountain and force him to return
            to court. Wishing to avoid the emperor's displeasure the igumen
            journeyed to Constantinople to explain what had become of John and
            begged him not to hinder the young man from his salvific path.
            
            <p/>Thereafter John Koukouzelis sang on the right cleros in the cathedral
            on Sundays and feastdays. Once, after singing an Akathist before an
            icon of the Mother of God, John was granted a great mercy. The Mother
            of God appeared to him in a dream and said, "Rejoice, John, and do not
            cease to sing. For that, I shall not forsake you." With these works
            she placed into John's hand a golden coin, then became invisible. This
            coin was placed beneath the icon. Many miracles have been credited to
            the coin and the icon. The icon, named the "Koukouzelissa" in memory
            of St. John is located in the Lavra monastery of St. Athanasios. It is
            commemorated on October 1, and on the 10th Friday after Pascha.
            
            <p/>The Mother of God appeared to St. John again and healed him of a
            grievous affliction of his legs, caused by the long standing in
            church. St. John's remaining days were spent in intense ascetic
            efforts. He also worked hard on the discipline of church singing,
            gaining the title of both master teacher and regent (overseer).
            
            <p/>He arranged and compiled melodies for church stichera verses, troparia
            and kontakia. He edited texts of hymns and wrote his own troparia.
            Some of his compositions are also in the following manuscripts: "A
            Book, by the Will of God Encompassing All the Order of Progression of
            Church Services, Compiled by Master Teacher John Koukouzelis,"            "Progression of Services, Compiled by Master Teacher John
            Koukouzelis,""From the Beginning of Great Vespers through to the
            Completion of the Divine Liturgy," and "The Science of Song and
            Singing Signs with all the Legitimate Hand-Placement and with all the
            Arrangements of Song."            
            <p/>Foreseeing the hour of his death, St. John took his leave of the
            brethren, and in his last wishes bade them to bury him in the Church
            of the Archangel that he built. Church singers reverence St. John
            Koukouzelis as their own special patron saint.
            
            <p/>Quote from a Bulgarian CD website (posted by S. Takis):
            
            <p/>The theory of Eastern Church chants (which are still employed by the
            Orthodox Church) was set up by St. John of Damascus in the 7th
            century. From the multiple religious hymns performed by the various
            Christian communities, St. John of Damascus chose only those which he
            thought most suitable for the uniform use by the Church and compiled
            the so called Vocal Eight-Part Chants Book, which is still in use by
            the Orthodox Church. The "Octoich" by St. John of Damascus is strictly
            defined within certain limits which restrict melody variation.
            Bulgaria adopted Christianity as its official religion in 865. About
            the same time, the brothers St. Cyril and St. Methodius created the
            Slavonic alphabet (the Cyrillic alphabet), which allowed for religious
            scriptures to be translated into the Slavonic languages, whereupon
            services began to be performed in the language of everyday use. These
            events served as the impetus of a tremendous cultural and political
            bloom, which continued for the following two centuries. The
            development of Eastern Orthodox singing saw another turning point
            between the 13th and the 14th centuries when the Byzantine emperor
            assigned John Kukuzel (The One Blessed with an Angel Voice) - a famous
            Bulgarian church musicologist of the time ? to create a new fashion of
            singing: more solemn and impressive than that of John of Damascus, so
            that it could correspond to the grandeur of the Byzantine Empire. John
            Kukuzel accomplished his assignment very successfully and created the
            new type of singing which was called 'Papadic singing'. He had left to
            the future generations a legacy of musical compositions of
            unattainable beauty and performing challenge, the most brilliant one
            being Selected Multiple Psalms to the Bulgarian Woman. The artist
            dedicated this work to his mother and used in it motifs from Bulgarian
            folk songs, which he had heard from his mother as a child. This set up
            the beginning of artistic singing in the Orthodox Church.

            <p/>S. Gugushvili:
            
            <p/>The OCA version of Koukouzelis' life that Stan Takis quoted is inaccurate.
            <br/>1) Since the date of his life is a disputed thing,there's no justification for claiming that Koukouzelis 
            lived during Ioannis Komnenos' times.
             <br/>2) Koukouzelis' vita says that he came to Athos without revealing his identity (he was very famous by then).
             That's why he was assigned a task of tending aflock of goats.
             <br/>3) "Thereafter John Koukouzelis sang on the right cleros in the cathedral
                        on Sundays and feastdays."            
                    Well, the choirs on Mt. Athos switch on a regular basis (that's a very old custom), so there was no permanent right choir.
                    
             <br/>4) "Once, after singing an Akathist before an icon of the Mother of God, John was granted a great mercy." [snip] 
               Actually according to the tradition Koukouzelis was chanting his own composition Anothenoi Profitai in front of 
               an icon of Theotokos (latercalled Koukouzelissa). Even now on the panygeris ofthe Great Lavra they chant 
               "Anothen oi Profitai" in front of this icon.
             <br/>5) I don't quite understand this one "He also worked hard on the discipline of church singing, gaining the
                                             title of both master teacher and regent"               <br/>On the excerpts from the Bulgarian CD:

            has been done by Edward V. Williams, in a Yale University PhD
            dissertation dating from the late 1960s (I don&#65533;t have the exact
            reference with me here in Greece) which you can procure from Ann Arbor
            Dissertation Microfilms."            
            <p/>In another discussion I had with Dr. Conomos, he mentioned that St John
            Koukouzeles uses the terms " Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian,
            Aeolian, etc." in his treatise, and this also points to a post-fourth
            crusade dating for his life.

            <p/>What else has been written about him?
            
            <p/>D. Koubaroulis:
            
            <p/>Author: Basileios Stephanides, Constantinopolitan Theoretician of the            
            Old Method (before 1814).
            
            <p/>In his 1819 treatise titled "Sketch of Music, In Particular The            
            Ecclesiastical One" ("Sxediasma Mousikes Idiaiteron Ekklesiastikes") he            
            writes
            
            <p/>$79
            
            <p/>"Some wonder whether since ancient times people chanted using different            
            pitches, that is whether they chanted together ("omou") some low, some            
            middle, some higher and some even higher as it can be found in the            
            Propaedian of the Papadike one troparion by Mister Ioannis Koukouzelis            
            in 2nd mode, Theotoke Parthene (composed in the way of tetraphonies            
            ("synthemenon kata ton dromon twn tetrafwniwn") that is the Trohos of            
            the same composer, in low ("esw") and high ("eksw"), that is in high            
            ("eis ypshlon") and low ("kai xamhlon")*, the difference of which is two            
            tetraphonies, but not eptaphonai according to the structure of            
            antiphonies (dk: that is not differing by one octave) but rather they            
            chanted all the same pitch as they do today in the Great Eastern Church,            
            in a manner that there is no difference in pitch between the co-chanters            
            apart from that that happens when men chant with children because the            
            voice of children corresponds to the antiphony of the men, whereas the            
            men chant in tones of the lower octave. In any case, it is certain that            
            the melody can sound nice and pleasing to the ear even when that octave            
            harmony is not there because the whole art of harmony consists of this:            
            to hear notes ("fthoggous") together with those of lower pitch OR WITH            
            THE ISON of the melody (" h me to ison ths melodias") and whether these            
            (dk: lower pitch?) notes are in the same scale/octave? ("eis thn idian            
            diapaswn") or in another harmonic one ("h eis allhn symfwnon") there is            
            no difference ("oligh h diafora"). So it seems that that was the reason            
            for devising modes and rules for compositions so that the melody keeps            
            the same mode i.e. the same scale ("thn dotheisan diapaswn") or so that            
            cadences don't happen elsewhere but only where the kind of melos of the            
            particular mode dictates".
            
            
            <p/>Stephanides was an opponent of the 3 Teachers and is respected for his            
            research and knowledge of the old method. His writing is obscure hence            
            the complex and confused translation above (perhaps someone else can do            
            a better job). Also can someone that knows more on this please explain            
            how does Stephanides proves that Koukouzelis' composition didn't imply            
            polyphony and what does it mean "eis esw kai eksw" (in low and high).            
            Does it just mean that the melos moves from low 2nd mode to high 2nd            
            mode or maybe something else? If it meant just that why would people get            
            confused just from that piece so as to think that Koukouzelis composed            
            in polyphony?
            
            <p/>I'd be grateful if one could shed some light on this.
            
            <p/>* the author here has got the order wrong probably.. low should correspond to "esw" and high to "eskw".. right?
            
            <p/>D. Koubaroulis:
                
            <p/>One may ask "so, where did Athonite yphos came from then?". The
            obvious answer (to me) is "from the source, from Constantinople". The two regions
            (Mt Athos and Constantinople had such close ties that it would be very strange
            (practically impossible in my opinion) to have different musical systems.
            Of course the performance style would be quite different but the music system...I
            believe it was the same. Think of that too.. St John Koukouzelis went to Mt
            Athos in the 13th century and given his fame it would seem quite unlikely
            that he would have had to learn a different musical system in order to be
            able to chant in Lavra Monastery but also that he didn't teach music to other
            Athonites.
