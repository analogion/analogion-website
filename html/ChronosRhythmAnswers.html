            <span ><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000000"><b>G. K. Michalakis:</b><spanstyle=""> Firstly</span><b>, </b><span style="">it is interesting to note that there
                    are many definitions for each of the terms "chronos" and "rhythmos",
                    with lots of overlap, and this leads to an overall confusion, not only among authors
                    but mostly those reading their explanations. My answers are based on things I have
                    been told, as well as my own personal organisation of all this information.<br>
                    <br>
                    In my view, it is important to <b>distinguish between "Rhythmos"</b>,
                    which is a <b>compositional criterion</b> (ie method of <b>notating</b> psaltic
                    neumes) <b>and "chronos",</b> which is the way the neumes are actually
                    <b>chanted </b>according to traditional means of allocating "units of time"                    to each neume. Using a compostion <b>written in a given "rhythmos"</b>
                    and c<b>hanting it usding different types of "chonos"</b> leads to creating
                    <b>"other rhythmos"</b>, which are <b>not written out</b>. If a computer
                    were to transcibe the way the simple rhythm hymns are actually chanted, the result
                    would be a very compicated score. The compication will arise because some "standard
                    unit of time" will have to be established by the compouter. When using a particular
                    choronos which varies the unit of time, the computer will have to find the smallest
                    unit of time so as to describe the rest of what it "hears". The end
                    result will be (in this particular case of "compolex chonos counting")
                    a score where there will be no gerular rhythm </span><b>within each measure (in contrast
                    </b><span style="">to the original, written forme of the composition, which has some
                        "rhythm regularity" <b>within</b> measures). Yet, regularity in terms
                        of duration is still maintained <b>among</b> measures.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Description of "chronos": </span>The <b>cyclical</b> motion
                of a hand, moving upwards to eye-level and coming down upon the knee of a sitting
                person is to be considered as <b>one</b> <b>complete</b> <b>chronos. </b>This
                does <b>not</b> necessarily imply <b>one measure</b>, because one cyclical motion
                may be used to describe anything from one <b>beat</b> to one <b>measure </b>to a
                <b>number </b>of measures.<br>
                <br>
                One chronos per beat = "monosimos" or "kata chronon paedagogical"<br>
                One chronos per measure = haplos when the duration of each beat's unit of time is
                constant or "kata chronon"<br>
                One chronos per "set" of measures" = "thesis to thesis"                counting, or "kata rhythmon". See below.<br>
                <br>
                Furthermore, chronos is also a generic term used to describe all phenomena
                having to do with the <b>intensity</b> of variations and durations within some <b>regular</b>
                temporal domain. "Good chronos" is sometimes used to describe
                a "good attack", a regularly good engagement into whatever measure is
                used.
                <br>
                <br>
                Finally, combining all of the above "regularity", "good engagement",
                "good intensity variations", good unit of time duration variations,
                etc may all be constituents of "good chronos".<br>

                intensity and unti of duration phenomena are subdivided and used gives rise to Haplos,

                the latter, of which I am an ardent defender. Haplos, diplos, and syneptigmenos
                <b>chronos</b> are <b>not</b> to be confused with <b>rhythmos</b>, which may be
                disimos, trisioms, tetrasimos, etc., and which is a matter of <b>compostion.</b>
                As an example, a <b>"terirem" composed in disimos rhythmos</b> as it
                is in classical editions may be "recomposed" as trisimos rhythmos as
                well, but the disimos rhythmos composition may be interpreted as either haplos,
                "kata chronon" or "kata rhythmon" (the term "syneptigmenos""                is sometimes used to describe this situation, when the tempo is quickened)</font><br>

            <span ><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000000">Nevertheless,
                the case of "diplos chronos" is an interesting case, because here one
                may see the link between "written form" rhythmos anda particualr interpretation
                giving rise to a new rhythmos. What is called "diplos chronos" can be
                though out as follows: take the syllabic heirmos "Anoixo". Either write
                out a new composition, or just chant it by makin the duration of each beat the double
                of its original value. While chanting, don't change the thesis (chant as if adding
                a "klasma") but add "neumes" so as to make some melodu on
                the arsis. If using the original syllabic score to do this, then the psaltis is
                interpreting according to "diplos chronos". However, if one is to write
                it out, as did Ioannis prosotpsaltis, we may say that the composition is written
                in a particular diplos "rhythmos"... the term does not exis, of course,
                but it shows how a single "paleographic" score can be used not only
                in terms of "rhythmic emphasis" (see below", but in terms of chronos
                variations as well, leading to numerous interpretations, even if we do not take
                into consideration the various "analyseis=developments".</font><br>

                "diplos chronos" in "Anoixo"</b> is interesting as well
                in that it helps demonstarate the difficulty of getting one's cho</font>nos
            correct. Some psaltis cannot vary the &laquo;arsis part&raquo; during
            a duration compatible with &laquo;diplous rhythmos&raquo;, and they
            end up doing &laquo;trisimos&raquo;. For excellent &laquo;chronos
            diplou, kata rhythmons&raquo;, listen to Metropolitis Eirinaios. Compare this

                <b>One</b> complete chronos duration may be divided into smaller temporal subsections.
                Their number and their combinations of duration may give anything from Disymos to
                anything else. Psaltiki does not use as many <b>rhythms</b> as demotic or "exoteric"                = external = non ecclesiastical music does. <b>Rhythmos</b> is used
                in <b>theoretcial</b> representations. A psaltis does not make use of <b>rhythmos</b>
                when interpreting but <b>only</b> when learning to chant a piece, in which case
                he counts accoridng to "chornos haplos paedagogikos": During this
                phase, the psaltis determines <b>regular</b> temporal "signposts", and
                then gives emphasis to different syllables depending on the accentuation and on
                the significance of the word, when doing the actual interpretation of the hymn.
                Strictly speaking, each syllable is no longer exactly equal to its neighbours as
                far as duration is concerned. Therefore, what was initially composed
                as disimos is no longer exactly disimos throughout during the interpretation, if
                this is done according to "kata rhythmon" or "syneptigmenos".
                Yet, the "signposts" are in the same temporal positions as with those
                of a pure, disimos rhythmos interpreted in haplos chornos. This is one great
                problem of contemporary psaltis, who seem to "drag" the melody.
                Once the hymn has been well integrated, they <b>way</b> it will sound will be determined
                by the <b>chronos</b>. Applying <b>rhythm</b> concepts instead of Chronos <b>podas</b>
                to <b>podas</b> thinking will <b>break</b> down the fluidity of a chanted hymn.
                On the other hand, not applying <b>rhythmos</b> when composing and when <b>learning</b>
                will, of course, lead to <b>unstructured</b> hymns. </font>

            <span ><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000000">One great problem
                with Gregorian chant is that there is no oral tradition as the <b>rhythm</b>&#8230;                By consequence, all neumes have been counted in <b>metrophonia</b>, according to
                different theories that give such and such a neume such or such an <b>identical temporal
                    (duration)</b> value, along with some <b>debatable</b> rhythmic concepts introduced
                by the Solemenian School, which give <b>perpetually</b> alternating <b>rhythms</b>

                the result being that all the interpretations we hear are "insipid". However, <b>many</b>
                such hymns seem to have <b>inherent</b> trisismos and Tetrasimos rhythm, which,
                when chanted as such may "disrespectfully add and subtract durations to the
                various neumes" but, when sung according to "kata rhythmon" or
                "syneptigmenos" chronos, will reveal the inherent beauty of these hymns,
                in complete agreement with the patriarchal "terirem" interpretation

                The lines <b>exist</b> in the composition, because there cannot be <b>expression</b>
                without rhythm. When the <b>composition</b> has <b>regular</b> rhythm with a <b>regular</b>
                syllable distribution, Chrysanthos speaks of <b>rhythmiki</b> <b>emphasis</b>. <b>Old</b>
                melodic formulae are almost always tetrasismos, and use the <b>same</b> number of
                syllables below them. Iakovos Prostopsaltis, "breaks" this tendency in some of his
                Doxology compositions. When comparing Antiphons of Holy Friday, Ephesios respects
                <b>more</b> of Rhythmic emphasis than does Stephanos and than do later on Iakovos
                Nafpliotis and Pringos, who are either transcribed (Iakovos by Boudouris) or who
                put on paper themselves (Pringos) <b>abrreviated</b> = <b>condensed</b> melodic
                formulae for the <b>same</b> number of syllables. Such abbreviated formulae are
                traditional condensed versions of older, more rhythmic emphasis respectful formulae.
                Therefore, vertical bars are to be used for <b>composition</b> and <b>learning</b>
                purposes. When one learns, one even counts <b>chronos</b> differently (haplos).
                When performing, however, the <b>more</b> one sees on the score; the <b>less</b>
                one is free, and the <b>less</b> one will think in terms of overall <b>chronos</b>
                (if one is to think in terms or <b>rhythmos</b> while performing Psaltiki, one will
                <b>lose</b> in fluidity). So, there is <b>no</b> <b>need</b> for vertical lines

                during church services), <b>chronos</b> is kept by an <b>ample</b> <b>circular</b>
                movement of one hand. The hand rises well above the head, from where it is suddenly
                thrust forward and downward in circular motion, not with constant speed, but with
                <b>acceleration</b>, before "<b>hitting</b>" the <b>minimal</b> height position
                (which is just in front of the thigh) which corresponds to the <b>thesis</b>, or
                the <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> part of a <b>measure</b>. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <span ><font face="Times New Roman">The return upwards is at constant speed,
                the same as that of the initial downward movement. You may wish to call this <b>maximal</b>
                height <b>position</b> <b>arsis</b>, but it does not always correspond to maxima=arsis=
                antipode of thesis, as it does in occidental musical theory books = . <b>thesis</b>
                and <b>only</b> <b>thesis</b> corresponds to <b>thesis</b>! 
            <br>
            <br>
            <span ><font face="Times New Roman">All <b>focuses</b> on the preparation
                of this thesis. The whole body <b>moves</b> so as to <b>establish</b> this regularity
                of <b>thesis</b> in the brain&#8230;. <b>Indeed, </b>if one wishes to learn
                <b>chronos</b>, one <b>must</b> <b>walk</b>, balance one's arms and <b>chant</b>
                according to <b>each thesis</b> <b>footstep</b>. Learning chronos while walking
                is important because of a <b>lever</b> effect: Legs are longer, and the brain has
                more time to <b>integrate</b> the <b>position</b> of the <b>thesis</b> once it has
                given out the command to take a step. Bringing chronos to the hand corresponds to
                <b>shortening</b> this lever effect. Just standing on an analoghion, leaning with
                both arms outstretched on the stasidion, and doing little cheiromic movements is
                certainly <b>not</b> keeping <b>chronos</b>, for there is no <b>lever</b> effect
                and, worse of all, if the chanter never <b>did</b> learn how to sing while <b>walking</b>,
                the correlation between vocal cords and hand by the brain is only <b>illusionary</b>!!!
                Doesn't the Euaggelion say something about this? So, not only does one learn <b>chronos</b>,
                but above all, one is in constant prayer by this method of chanting while walking.<br>
            <br>
            <span ><font face="Times New Roman">Getting back to practising <b>chronos</b>
                with my teacher (he was too short so as to keep up with me using a constant pace,
                so he showed me the method and let me work on it). We then resorted to using
                the <b>ample</b> <b>circular</b>, <b>thesis</b>-<b>oriented</b> acceleration movement
                of the hand: the whole <b>body</b> was programmed to strive towards the <b>thesis</b>.
            
            <br>
            <br>
            <span ><font face="Times New Roman">For those that have also studied traditional
                Hellenic dances as myself, the principle is the same: for most dances, it's the
                <b>right</b> foot (<b>podas</b>) that controls all movement so as to coincide with
                the musician's <b>thesis</b>. Now, one should not confound the <b>poetic</b> <b>arsis</b>,
                which is the <b>accentuated</b> syllable, for which the voice goes up by at least
                a fifth (and which thus corresponds to the <b>musical</b> <b>thesis</b>), with the
                <b>musical</b> Arsis. Poetic <b>arsis</b> (accentuated syllable) thus corresponds
                to Musical <b>thesis</b> for which the <b>podas</b> (the foot) should be stepping
                forth.<br>
            <br>
            <span ><font face="Times New Roman">What is the importance of all this <b>
                ample</b> movement? It is that of <b>engaging</b> correctly into the following <b>thesis</b>!
                <b>so</b>, once my hand is up, I'm <b>already</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b>
                <b>my</b> <b>consonants</b>, in such manner as to have completed their vocalisation
                and to be started on that of the <b>vowel</b> when my hand is in front of my chest.
                At this point, the vowel is fully articulated, just in time for the <b>accelerating</b>
                movement, which will give my <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> impetus so as to <b>explode</b>
                that vowel upon the hand's arrival at the <b>thesis</b> position. If I have <b>many</b>
                consonants, I prepare them even <b>before</b> the return to the "<b>arsis</b>" position.
                I hope it is becoming evident that <b>arsis</b> is almost illusionary, especially
                in rapid tempo.<br>

                the temporal opposite of <b>thesis</b>: it is just an upwards movement of the hand,
                whereas <b>thesis</b> is an <b>exact</b> <b>explosion</b> of <b>sound</b>!!! So
                why did Tsolakidis use <b>three</b> body parts to count tempo? Well, at the analoghion,
                we do not have the luxury of <b>ample</b> circular motion, nor that of being able
                to "<b>skip</b>" a step (just as one might do so as to walk in pace at a military
                parade in case everybody else is on pace on the <b>other</b> foot!) for rhythmic
                changes. Stylianos <b>Tsolakidis</b> would stand up straight, head tilted slightly
                upwards, facing the icon of <b>Jesus</b> at the <b>north</b> entrance (so, he wasn't
                looking at books, he wasn't hanging on to some stasidion, and both his arms dropped
                beside his thighs). He kept chronos with small movements of the <b>left</b> hand,
                with a slight touch of his fingers upon his left thigh. The left foot would discretely
                tap every 2nd <b>thesis</b> (importance of <b>equilibrated</b> 4/4 measures in most
                chants of tradition). His right hand would take control fro rhythmical changes,
                by transiently counting both <b>thesis</b> and <b>arsis</b>, and the left hand would
                pick up again.<br>

            <span ><font face="Times New Roman"><b>G. K. Michalakis. </b>There is a
                difference when counting Chronos in a Kalophonikos Heirmos, vs. a Canona, vs.Cheroubikon,
                vs the Epinikios Hymnos (victory Hymn) in 2nd mode (syneptigmenos). Today's chanters
                do not distinguish but two varieties: Kalophonikos style and an almost 1-2
                "schola" chronos. This means that the Cheroubikon of most chanters sounds as a Kalophonikos
                Heirmos (sometimes, it is so "loose" is chronos, that it becomes a "drunk man's
                song" type of chanting). This also means that the "Agios, agios" of
                the Liturgy of Megas Vasileios is just simply "faster". I sent out some samples
                of the canon, for instance. What's the difference between that and what we hear
                today: the way I count the chronos? If the piece sounds "heavy" in that it is not
                "melsimatic", it is not "super trilled" in a 1-2 count as Stanitsas would do it.
                Let's take the Agios Agios: one should not count in twos, but in fours. That is,
                the First thesis is fundamental, and all the other three counts are "free" (the
                two mesis and the arsis are not always in the same place"). Now, it takes a lot
                of listening to do that correctly. As far as Iakovos'<b> recordings</b> are concerned,
                and according to Tsolakidis, he used the simplest way to count time. Apparently,
                he had more of a pedagogical goal in mind rather than to show off. So, the "Tin
                gar sin mitran" he has chanted on record is <b>not</b> the "ultimate"                in chronos complexity he'd execute.<br>

            <b>A. Lingas</b>: There appears to be some confusion here between 'rhythm' and 'metre'.
            As Fr. Constantine and Don have pointed out, the idea of music without rhythm is
            problematic (as avant garde composers who have tried to write pieces without rhythm
            have discovered), because pitches will inevitably have a measurable duration. In
            'free rhythm' the durations supposedly do not adhere exactly to prescribed and predetermined
            values, but are supposed to vary according to a number of factors: e.g. the shape
            of the phrase, the text, signs of indeterminate lengthening or shortening. This
            is certainly not true of Kievan square notes or Chrysanthine notation, both of which
            possess a hierarchy of predetermined note values (which may be affected, of course,
            in performance by rubato, 'lilt', etc.). In the case of either notation, it is possible
            to provide bar lines for chants originally written without them in order to clarify
            the larger rhythmic groups which are the constituent elements of the metre, which
            may be irregular. Consequently, a transcription of Slavonic or Byzantine chant without
            bar lines (other than a recitative) that faithfully renders the relative durations
            of the original notation would certainly have both rhythm and metre (the divisions
            of the latter would simply remain unnotated, as in the original).<br>

            As for 'free rhythm' in medieval Byzantine chant, this concept was imported by Tillyard
            and Wellesz from the Solesmes school of interpreting Gregorian chant. They did this
            for a variety of scholarly and ideological reasons reasons and without getting into
            the historiographic issues here (my forthcoming Royaumont paper discusses them in
            some detail), it might be useful for me to note that the rhythmic theories of Dom
            Mocquereau--despite their wide influence--have been thoroughly discredited. Even
            at the time that Mocquereau was propounding his theories, many other scholars of
            Gregorian chant rejected his interpretations, preferring instead a variety of 'mensural'
            interpretations (substantiated by some medieval theorists) in which Gregorian neumes
            had precise durations. The debate continues to this day<br>
            (for brief introductions to these issues, see David Hiley's Western Plainchant:
            A Handbook and his remarks about Gregorian chant in the medieval section of the
            New Grove article on performing practice).<br>
            <br>
            Regarding rhythm in medieval Byzantine notation, I defer to my colleague Ioannis
            Arvanitis, who has done extensive work on the subject.<br>

                The main witness is Chrysanthos, who says the following: He was a good grammarian
                and would have been an excellent chanter if he didn't have bad rhythm (eton
                kakorhythmos). This is because, ignoring the rules of rhythm and poetry--supposedly
                to preserve</i> <i>the meaning of the troparion--he didn't preserve the rhythm of the</i>
                 <i>prosomoia.</i> <i><b>ok</b>, now I understand that the problem isn't concerned
                    with Iakovos' Papadic compositions or Doxastarion, Chrysanthos talks about prosomia.</i></font><br>
            <br>
            <b>A. Lingas:</b> According to Chrysanthos Iakovos' general stance was one of conservatism
            (cf. ThM, <b>ii</b>, li, where he says that Iakovos 'did not really approve of innovations
            (den echaire toson eis neoterismous)'. Iakovos' conservatism seems to have led him
            into conflict with Agapios and, if you prefer, at least profound disagreement with
            Petros over two areas: a) melodic style and b) performance practice. How these were
            related is hard to discern from the brief comments of Chrysanthos, who was in any
            case clearly biased toward Petros.<br>
            <br>
            <b>S. Gugushvili:</b><font color="#ff0000"><i> He admits that Iakovos knew the
                grammar well. What could "supposedly</i> <i>to preserve the meaning of the troparion"                    refer to? Can it mean that he was avoiding wrong accentuation/paratonismos?
                    On the other hand "he  didn't preserve the rhythm of the prosomoia" seems
                    to  be contradicting to this conjecture. In general, how</i> <i>could Iakovos
                        be "a good grammarian", if he was ignoring "the rules of rhythm and
                        poetry"?</i></font><br>
            <br>
            <b>A. Lingas:</b> Although Chrysanthos mentions the prosomoia as his specific example,
            it remains possible that his general condemnation of Iakovos as 'kakorhythmos' affected
            his performance of other repertories. Since this is hard to prove with the available
            evidence, I won't insist on this idea.<br>
            <br>
            Nevertheless, it is worth remembering that one of the New Method's greatest achievements
            was the systematisation of different levels of rhythmic subdivision, something that
            the medieval notation could only show by implication. In the absence of the Chrysanthine
            system's precise regulation of rhythm through gorga, digorga, etc., it is conceivable
            that a chanter reading from the old notation could have exercised in performance
            a greater degree of rhythmic freedom than would generally be allowed when reading
            from scores written according to the New Method (itself a product of Petros' students).<br>

                That being said, some cantors today may be heard who sing either occasionally or
                constantly with a great degree of rubato, turning apparently regular rhythms into
                a kind of dramatic recitative (Vasilikos, for example, does this at times).<br>

                heirmologion of Balasios? What might be wrong with it? In general can we fit somehow

            in saying that Petros and Iakovos were, inmany ways, going in the same direction.
            As we know from today's chant scene, however, going in the same general direction
            is not enough to eliminate conflicts between, for example, various teachers and
            their partisans (Karas, Stathis, Simonopetrites, Angelopoulos, etc.).</p>

                <b>I. Arvanitis:</b> I think that , in order to understand the passage of Chrysanthos
                concerning the 'rhythm' of Iakovos' singing, we must have in mind the original (or
                another, old) meaning of the word 'rhythm', ie. 'shape'. In this sense we can also
                speak about 'rhythm' in the visual arts. So, Iakovos was distroying the 'shape'
                of the automelon, so that its prosomoion has a full (entelh) cadence at the end
                of a period of the words, a medial cadence at the place of a comma of the words
                of the prosomoion, in others words to make the syntactic structure of the prosomoion
                conform with its music. But because the syntactic structure of the prosomoion does
                not always coincide with the syntactic structure of the automelon, Iakovos tried
                to alter the music of the Automelon when adapting the words of the prosomoion (retaining
                of course some similarity to the music of the Automelon) , so the music of the prosomoion
                reflects faithfully its syntactic structure. So, he was singing with (Chrysanthos'
                expression:) 'melopoiia kata ta nooumena', ie. setting to music according to the
                meaning. This is exactly reflected in the whole Iakovos' work: eg. in his Doxologies.
                The older Doxologies by Balasios, Bereketis, Germanos and, to a lower degree those
                by Daniel and Petros Lampadarios, follow basically the same pattern in every one
                of their verses. Although the verses of a doxology are not prosomoia, their singing,
                as well as the singing of the old or older polyeleoi, followed the custom found
                in the ancient psalmody (see eg. the rubrics in Asmatic offices; very often only
                the music of the first verse is given in the Mss and the rest are sung 'according
                to this'), ie. a certain pattern to be followed (the same custom holds also for
                western psalmody). But Iakovos Doxologies deviate strongly from this rule; they
                are composed according the meaning, using new high or low points, phthorai and ither
                devices of 'word painting'. In other words, they are not so much 'strophic'; they
                are 'through composed'. The same manner of composition has strongly affected his
                Doxastarion: in a frame of old sticheraric, traditional, long 'theseis', new compositional
                devices are present, eg. a) new (frequent) use of phthorai but through old formulas
                b) short sticheraric formulas (coinciding to the ones by Petros) etc. So, Iakovos
                is at the same time traditional and innovative. He wanted to protect the long old
                sticherarion (= his conservatism) from disappearance (it was thought already as
                too long, so Iak. composed only a Doxastarion and not a full stichararion), but
                he thought he had to shorten and to 'modernize' it (through devices like the above
                mentioned ), so that at least something of it be preserved; this was maybe the only
                way to for the old sticherarion to survive. (I have collected material for writing
                an article on Iakovos' Doxastarion and its notation. I don't know when I'll be able
                to write it. You know about my situation. Maybe I'll have the chance to present
                it in some conference)<br>

                On the matters of phrasing and paratonismoi in prosomoia, I 'd have much to say
                (defending the older books) , but allow me to stop here for the present. I hope
                to give details in my PhD. My article that Shota referred to, give some basic things
                on this. Concerning the style of composing old stichera, Wellesz is still valuable,
                as well some articles by J. Raasted. What is important, is that the Melodoi were
                very artful and careful when composing. As I have studied and concluded, the manner
                of composition of the now used chants (I mean the 'classical' compositions) has
                its roots in their work (despite the apparent differences). So, one should not easily
                criticize the older composers (eg. Petros) as not having composed artfully and appropriately.
