            "Distinguished nice-voiced Protopsaltis and teacher of Byzantine Music. He was born
            in Vounargon, a village close to Pyrgos (Ilia, Greece). From a very young age he
            stood out for his impressive voice and his talent in the Psaltic Art. He got his
            first lessons on the analogion, close to the Protopsaltis of Pyrgos, George
            Lainas. Later on, he studied with other well known Protopsaltai such as Dimitrios
            Mitrou, Kyriazis Kyriazis and finally with Harilaos Taliadoros. He studied at the
            National Conservatorium of Greece ("Ethnikon Odeion") from where he received his
            degree of a teacher of Byzantine Music. Since 15 years ago, he teaches the Psaltic
            Art in the school of Byzantine Music of the Holy Metropolis of Ilia. Many of his
            students are now sucessfully serving as competent psaltai in churches of the
            Holy Metropolis of Ilia and elsewhere. He has chanted in many churches and today
            he honours the holy right analogion of the cathedral of St Nicholas of Pyrgos. He
            has got many admirers and fans-immitators of his art.<br>
            <br>
            A wonderful person, modest with integrity and virtue, with rich spiritual gifts,
            he enjoys everybody's respect and love. An excellent chanter with nice,
            melodic and captivating voice and with serious, ecclesiastical expression ("yphos"),
            he chants with modestly and reverence and serves with piety and dedication our liturgical
            tradition."<br>

            Kounas was also the first to establish a children's choir in the Metropolis of Ilia
            which gave many concerts with great success in local parishes and halls of the Metropolis.
            Below is a sample from one of the concerts. The choir was taken over by his student
            George Papageorgiou who continues to direct it sucessfully up to this day.
            <br>
            <br>
            His students are now running the school of Byzantine Music of the Metropolis which
            numbers some 150 students, some of them with exceptional talent.<br>
            <br>
            His teaching style was aimed primarily at children which he encouraged to go to
            the analogion and chant with him. He never expelled any kid from the analogion.
            He always let kids chant few simple pieces per service. At almost every service
            there used to be 2-3 kids at the analogion.
            <br>
            <br>
            He used to teach 3-4 days a week at two different parishes, many classes in an evening.
            Adults and kids, often together, but always paying attention to the children.
            <br>
            <br>
            He did many radio broadcasts with Byzantine music. For some time, he ran a weekly
            half-hourly radio program with Byzantine hymns chanted by his children pupils.
            <br>
            <br>
            His teaching style consisted of a full practical (listen/study/repeat) first years
            leaving theory for later. He characteristically used to reply to theoretical questions
            with "You will learn these later...".<br>
            <br>
            He stopped teaching prematurely at his prime time due to vocal strain but he continues
            to chant as Protopsaltis of the cathedral up to this day. Below is a recent
            sample of him chanting "Ton Despotin" in Varys mode.
            <br>
            <br>
            From his students we mention the current Lambadarios of the cathedral of Pyrgos
            Ilia, Mr George Papageorgiou, the Protopsaltis of St Nicholas, Spata, Ilia,
            Mr. George Stathopoulos, the Lambadarios of the cathedral of Sydney, Australia,
            Dr. D. Koubaroulis and many others who are now chanting and teaching Psaltiki in
            Greece and abroad.
