        a) Maybe this needs a small correction. There is also ''Agapiso se<br>
        Kyrie'' by Iakovos Protopsaltis (two papadic versions, one longer, the other<br>
        a little shorter), and ''Patera Yion'' by Ioannis Trapezountios in papadic<br>
        style and small terrirem, Mode II. In the oldest published books, ''Agapiso<br>
        se Kyrie'' in Varys Mode (the same music as the corresponding Prokeimenon of<br>
        the Lord's Feasts, ascribed to Gregorios Protopsaltis), another in<br>
        sticheraric (short melismatic) style, in Mode II from Di, called ''Palaion''<br>
        (anyway, it does not seem to be very old ), as well as ''Patera Yion'' in<br>
        Varys Mode of the short melismatic style. All these were chanted in the<br>
        Liturgy of St John Chrysostom, I suppose, but, of course, on the occasion of<br>
        a celebration with bishops. But these are some Leitourgika for this Liturgy,<br>
        aren't they? (Of course, we must admit, they are not the brief responses to<br>
        the priest).<br>
        b) There were also older Leitourgika by Georgios Redaistinos and Onoufrios<br>
        Vyzantios (19th cent) in the Mode II before Pringos and Stanitsas. These<br>
        Leitourgika were not sung in the Patriarchate. But if this is a reason to<br>
        exclude them from the Church, we should also exclude a lot of chants:<br>
        Anoiksantaria, Theotoke Parthene by Bereketis, Koinonika of the older<br>
        composers etc etc because they are forbidden or not mentioned in the<br>
        encyclicals of the Patriarchate (eg. the one of 1880 by Gr. Stathis and<br>
        found also in G. Papadopoulos) or exclude later compositions by composers<br>
        who really follow the tradition and produce true liturgical music (eg. the<br>
        Cherouvika by K.Psachos et al) .<br>

        <i>Regarding point a), as far as is normally observed, Iakobos'
            <br>
            compositions are often 'syntmeseis' of the older, Byzantine, ones&#8212;most
            <br>
            often Chrysaphes the New. I would venture that the same holds true for
            <br>
            the Ioannis Trapezountios composition. Nevertheless, as ancient
            <br>
            melodies, and by ancient we could extend all the way up to the Fall for
            <br>
            our purposes here, they would nevertheless have been composed for the
            <br>
            liturgy of St Basil and then, by extension, when the liturgy was
            <br>
            replaced by that of st John Chrysostom on most Sundays, compositions
            <br>
            such as those of Io. Trap. would have imitated the older style,
            <br>
            condensing it to fit the new needs. As I know you well know, Io.
            <br>
            Trapezountios marks the beginning of the New Sticheraric style, still
            <br>
            with us today.<br>
            <br>
            In any event, in using the term 'litourgika' I think I am looking more
            <br>
            so at the Kyrie eleeson, Soi Kyrie, Axion kai dikaion, in other words,
            <br>
            the short responses, not so much hymnic content points.<br>
            <br>
            On point b), again, I'm not considering hymnic content as leitourgika
            <br>
            in my comments. I'm referring specifically to the response elements,
            <br>
            that are not dealt with in the ms tradition of the liturgies until just
            <br>
            recently. Neither, am I suggesting that the Patriarchal practice is our
            <br>
            only benchmark, although it is probably one of the most important, if
            <br>
            not the most important, along with the Athos mss. This is so mostly
            <br>
            just because they are the two traditions we have sufficient material
            <br>
            about which to study.<br>

        I have sung the 'Chyma' Leitourgika from Di with the Kliton (the common<br>
        style of melodic recitation) many times as they were sung in the<br>
        Patriarchate and of course I agree that they are modest and prayerful<br>
        (though, according to my sense, they should be sung by the whole choir and<br>
        not only by a 'Diavastis') and solve many problems arising from not<br>
        musically apt and learned priests, but I had always a question: are not<br>
        ''Agios, Agios'' and ''Se ymnoumen'' <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span class="moz-txt-tag">
            _</span>hymns<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>? Why should then they
        be simply<br>
        recited and not sung, as it is done in St Basil's Liturgy?(Only these chants<br>
        are transmitted in the Mss, the other used probably to be simple responses).<br>
        But, if the Sunday Liturgy is now that of St Chrysostom, why not <span class="moz-txt-underscore">
            <span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>sing<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span><br>
        Leitourgika (at least the above mentioned hymns) on Sundays? The 'Chyma'<br>
        Leitourgika can be reserved for weekdays.<br>
        The problem, I think, is not to sing or not to sing Leitourgika, but how<br>
        much we respect the whole tradition of Byzantine Chant and its <span class="moz-txt-underscore">
            <span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>ethos<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>
        when<br>
        composing new music in general or Leitourgika in particular. Unfortunately,<br>
        this has not happened with most compositions for Leitourgika. The 'need' for<br>
        their composition came in a time when Byzantine Chant began to incorporate<br>
        influences from the secular music, especially from the Ottoman music (we<br>
        must admit this for this period. The titles of some compositions, like<br>
        ''Typika in Maqam Tahir Buselic by Vasileios Zagliverinos'', ''Leitourgika<br>
        in Adjem Kiurdi by K.Pringos'' etc etc, speak by themselves), influences<br>
        that very seldom were fruitfully incorporated in Byz. Chant (remember, that<br>
        only Petros Bereketis, an older composer of course, was considered by his<br>
        contemporaries as doing this with success). Other hymns, like Cherouvika,<br>
        were more 'happy' to fall in the hands of composers like Kladas, Chrysaphes<br>
        etc when passing from the one mode-tradition (II or Pl II) to the eight<br>
        modes tradition. So, it became a tour de force for a psaltis to show his<br>
        knowledge in maqams and to compose Leitourgika or othes chants in their<br>
        scales or using melodic formulas influenced by secular music. And the<br>
        Protopsaltai of the Patriarchate, like Pringos, were, unfortunately the<br>
        first to do that (to be honest, Pringos did not want them to be published,<br>
        saying that they used to be sung in ''panigyria''- with a negative tone of<br>
        the word- where he used to go for money, but the bad thing had already been<br>
        done: the psaltai thought that this was the true tradition of the<br>
        Patriarchate). So, now Leitourgika in various modes (and maybe maqams) are<br>
        normally sung in the patriarchate.<br>
        I think that it is now very difficult or impossible to revert the direction<br>
        or the river (and , of course, one could argue, why should we). I think that<br>
        we must simply try not to eliminate but to improve this situation. There are<br>
        already compositions of the Leiturgika in a classical heirmologic or short<br>
        papadic style (even a Constantinopolitan, Alexandros Kehayiopoulos reacted<br>
        to the extreme use of maqams, or of westernized melodies, and composed<br>
        Leitourgika in the heirmologic style) which can be preferred instead of such<br>
        extravagant compositions as that by Pringos or Stanitsas or other later<br>
        composers (not all but most of them are, I think, beyond what can be called<br>
        a continuation of the tradition of Byz. Chant or appropriate for the moment<br>
        of the Anaphora) . I have also composed Leitourgika (unpublished but some<br>
        circulate among the psaltai) based on heirmologic or other genres of the<br>
        traditional Byz, Chant but let others speak about them (anyone who knows<br>
        them). But even a greater problem are the priests. Not musically untrained<br>
        priests, but they who are musically apt or trained. Because they very often<br>
        recite- or should we say 'sing' ?- in a much more secularized style than the<br>
        psaltai themselves. Instead of reciting basically on a dominant tone of a<br>
        mode and with a restricted ambitus, they 'chop' the text in small bits to be<br>
        able to make many phrases and use the whole scale, something that makes the<br>
        text lose its power and that brings another <span class="moz-txt-underscore"><span            class="moz-txt-tag">_</span>ethos<span class="moz-txt-tag">_</span></span>,
        much more than the<br>
        singing of 'maqamized' Leitourgika. The formation of a new tradition for<br>
        reciting in various modes and be inside the traditional ethos can be based,<br>
        according to my view, on the traditional way of reciting the stichoi before<br>
        the Stichera. I have found simple motives that can be used for the cadences<br>
        of such a reciting (sometimes it can be the same motive with various<br>
        intervals for each mode, eg. Ke, di ga di KE zo(b) Ke, with ga natural for<br>
        Pl. I and III modes, with ga # for Pl. II, the same motive Zo Ke# DI kE# ZO<br>
        NI Zo for Varys etc). That can be a simple solution but, let the priests in<br>
        the list forgive me, how and how many priests can be persuaded to do so? (I<br>
        leave the question open. Anyway, it has more to do with Greek priests!). It<br>
        seems, finally, that the various problems about music in Church are not<br>
        problems concerning only the psaltai but the whole Church (clergy and laity;<br>
        the laity also because the admiration, very often at the level of a star<br>
        system, without discretion and deeper sense or 'fear of God' of whatever has<br>
        been sung by eminent psaltai, has led the latter to abandon very often the<br>
        tradition and sing everything else but liturgical music).<br>
